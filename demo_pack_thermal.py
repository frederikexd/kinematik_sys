"""
demo_pack_thermal.py — the requested workflow, end to end.

Script a virtual lap (the car pulls hundreds of amps on every corner exit),
predict which lithium-ion cells climb toward their limit FIRST given an airflow
map, then let the tool pick the cooling-fan placement that keeps the hottest cell
coolest — all in software.

Run:  python demo_pack_thermal.py

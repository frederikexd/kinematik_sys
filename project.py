Project memory: weight budget, decision log, and handover report.

Two problems this solves for an underfunded team:

  WEIGHT BUDGET — the lightest reliable car is one of the few advantages money
  can't buy. But a budget that lives in one senior's spreadsheet dies when they
  graduate. Here it's a tracked, per-team running total against a target, with
  mass either estimated from CAD volume + material or entered by hand.

  HANDOVER — every year a team loses the *reasoning* behind its car: why the roll
  centre is where it is, why the battery box moved, what didn't work. Incomplete
  handover is how a team repeats last year's mistakes. So decisions are logged as
  they happen, and a one-click report bundles geometry + parts + weight + decisions
  into something next year's team can actually read.

Everything persists to JSON on disk (project.json) so it survives between sessions
and can be committed to the repo — the tool itself becomes the record, not a
person's memory. The report renders to Markdown, PDF, and JSON ("all of the above").

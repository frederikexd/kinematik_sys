Demo: the higher-fidelity in-house aero — a 3D source-panel (boundary-element)
potential-flow solve on a REAL STL, with a ground plane.

Unlike the analytic surrogate (which curve-fits coefficients to attitude and does
not move when the geometry changes), this method SOLVES a flow on the actual surface
mesh. The headline thing to watch: GROUND EFFECT emerges from the physics. We lower
the car and downforce grows — not because of a tuned `ride_ground_gain` constant, but
because the road's image-panel system genuinely strengthens as the body nears the
ground.

It is still inviscid potential flow: no separation, no stall, no real wake. That is
exactly what the ANSYS Fluent verification deck (written for every case) exists to
check. The number is labelled POTENTIAL fidelity and UNCORRELATED, honestly.

No license, no external solver. Needs numpy + trimesh (already in requirements).

Run:  python demo_panel_method.py

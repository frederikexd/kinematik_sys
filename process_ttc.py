"""
TTC tire-data processing — validate the grip model against measured tire data.

⚠ LICENSING: TTC (Tire Test Consortium) data is provided under a confidentiality
agreement. The raw .mat files AND any coefficients fitted from them must NOT be
committed to the public repository. This whole folder is gitignored. Keep the
.mat files and any output you produce here local to your machine / your team's
private storage. The open-source KinematiK ships only with the placeholder grip
model; the TTC-derived model loads separately from a local file that never enters
git. This is how you stay compliant while still using real data internally.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Loads a TTC cornering .mat file, cleans it the standard way, and extracts the
load-sensitivity curve (peak friction coefficient mu vs vertical load Fz). That
curve is what validates — or corrects — KinematiK's grip model, which currently
assumes a straight line mu = mu_peak - load_sens * Fz.

Run:  python tire_tools/process_ttc.py path/to/your_cornering_file.mat

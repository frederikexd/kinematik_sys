# ◢ KinematiK

**Open-source architecture-agnostic suspension studio.**
Born as a Formula SAE double-wishbone tool, now a general multibody kinematics platform: edit hardpoints live for *any* topology — double wishbone, MacPherson strut, multi-link, trailing / semi-trailing arm, solid axle, twist-beam, or a heavy-truck steering linkage — and see the kinematics *and* the vehicle-level consequences update together, in the browser, for free. You can also drop in entirely experimental linkages that fit no textbook geometric definition, and edit their pickups the same way.

---

## 30-second tour (every tab)

Sixteen tabs, front to back. Each takes the live geometry + setup and answers one question; nothing is retyped between them — mass/CG, peak currents, ride heights and the tire all flow from one source of truth.

1. **KINEMATICS** — the 3D constraint solver. Edit hardpoints live for **any** topology — not just the double wishbone's ten points, but every pickup, free joint and carrier point of a strut, multi-link, trailing arm, solid axle, twist-beam, truck steer linkage, or free-form `from_links` corner — and read camber gain, bump steer (toe vs travel), caster, KPI, scrub radius, the front-view instant centre, the **real motion ratio** off the pushrod/rocker (→ wheel rate, rising/falling-rate curve), and **anti-dive / anti-squat** from the side-view swing arm. Pick the topology in the sidebar; each one keeps its own edited geometry and re-solves through the same agnostic engine.
2. **ROLL & LOAD TRANSFER** — roll-centre height and *migration* through travel/roll, and the front/rear lateral load-transfer split that migration drives — the geometry→balance link the spreadsheets skip.
3. **GRIP BALANCE** — turns that split + the tire into an understeer/oversteer verdict at the limit: does the car push or rotate, and by how much.
4. **3D MODEL** — the live 3D view, with a toggle between two views. *Linkage geometry* draws just the suspension members and wheel envelope (any topology) for a visual sanity-check of the mechanism and travel sweep. *Full car* renders a **true Formula Student EV** assembled from every subsystem's current declaration — a pointed nosecone and low survival cell, multi-element **front and rear wings on endplates**, an open cockpit with **main and front roll hoops** and the driver's **helmet**, sidepods (sized by cooling airflow), a rear **traction motor + inverter** (sized by power), the accumulator, brake discs (sized by torque), and the CG marker from the mass roll-up — so editing a hardpoint, spring rate, downforce or battery mass anywhere in the app visibly moves the matching body here. **Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-drag to pan; click any part to auto-zoom:** picking a body — suspension, aero, powertrain, cooling, electrics, brakes, chassis or data-acq — spotlights it and reframes the camera onto that part; the spotlight picker does the same, and "Reset zoom" pulls back to the whole-car shot.
5. **COMPLIANCE (FLEX)** — the links aren't rigid: pick a lateral g and tube size (optionally chassis-tab stiffness in series, or a condensed FEA flex body) and read the deflected toe/camber — the ADAMS-Flex-style compliance most free tools assume away. The same structural layer also carries an analytic **bolted-joint check** (`bolted_joint.py`): preload from torque, the joint load factor, and whether a braking load pries the pedal-box base off its tabs (VDI 2230 / Shigley — separation, bolt stress, washer-face crush).
6. **TEAM FIT** — the cross-team CAD check: any subteam loads the shared chassis as reference, then drops in their part (caliper, radiator, battery box, wing mount, ECU tray) and gets the same collision / tight / clear verdict suspension gets — catch interference before the first cut.
7. **WEIGHT & HANDOVER** — the mass + CG ledger (the single source the load-transfer model reads), a **searchable design-decision log** (log a decision with rationale/author/part, then find it by free-text, team, tag or part), and a one-click **handover export** in three formats — Markdown, raw project `.json`, and a formatted **PDF** — so design decisions and their evidence survive a roster change. Unresolved lead notes are carried into the export as loose interface ends.
8. **LEAD NOTES** — cross-team notes between subsystem leads, addressed to a team (or all), each with an open/resolved status and `requests action` / `urgent` flags, so a note is a tracked action item rather than a Discord message that scrolls away. Notes persist next to the work in the project (`project.json`, or Supabase when configured) and carry into the PDF handover as unresolved interface items. **Live notification:** when any lead posts a note, every other open session is notified within ~10 s — a toast pops on whatever tab they're viewing and an unread badge appears on the LEAD NOTES tab. A short-interval `st.fragment` poller does this without re-running the heavy app body; the poster never gets toasted by their own note, opening the tab clears the badge, and if a note can't reach shared storage the poster is warned that others won't see it. An open-item summary chips the count per team, and any note can be marked resolved / reopened.
9. **TIRE & GRIP** — the Pacejka MF5.2 lateral model: load sensitivity, camber response, peak-µ / optimal-camber search, combined-slip friction ellipse, relaxation length, and the **thermal channel** (warm-up / working-range / pressure). Load your tire either way — upload an already-fitted `my_tire.json`, **or drop a raw TTC cornering `.mat`/`.csv` straight from the rig** and the app cleans it, fits the Magic Formula in-browser (R²/RMSE reported), applies it live, and hands you back the private JSON to keep. Everything downstream then uses *your* tire; uncalibrated channels stay flagged, never faked.
10. **SETUP OPTIMISER** — sweeps the physical levers (spring rates, ARB, ride height …) through the motion ratio and **ranks setups by lap delta**; sensitivity()/optimise() never return a setup worse than the start.
11. **LAP TIME** — quasi-steady-state point-mass lap with a configurable powertrain & aero block: the three timed FSAE events out of the box — skidpad (one timed circle), 75 m accel (standing-start integration) and autocross — using aero + a real motor torque map; **track from GPS/cone coordinates** and a curvature-optimal **racing line** with the seconds it gains.
12. **GGV DIAGRAM** — the accel-lateral-velocity envelope the lap sim rides, drivable from the live vehicle + the same powertrain, with a one-click check that GGV and lap sim agree.
13. **TRANSIENT** — the unsteady half of the lap: an explicit high-frequency time-step solver for turn-in and pitch built on relaxation length + the damper model, the thing QSS assumes away. Run a manoeuvre, export the time history as `.csv`, and save/restore the whole working project as `.json`.
14. **VALIDATION** — earn trust by matching data. Skidpad g / circle time, 75 m accel, and a GPS **speed-trace** RMSE/bias/R²; the **Virtual Tunnel Solver** (sweep the physical aero map → **write the solver case files** → run the matched k-omega SST points through **Star-CCM+, TS-Auto *and* OpenFOAM at once** → fuse them into one cross-code **consensus**, with the **inter-code spread** as the confidence signal → point-by-point C_l/C_d/balance calibration); **surface pressure taps** (raw volts → C_p on the wing → stall detection → RMSE vs CFD); and the **live acquisition front end** — a Virtual Instrument off the force balance + Scanivalve/Chell scanners that decouples the 6×6 balance and filters the fan tone (offline *or* real-time) into clean F_x/F_y/F_z and raw P_static. Any correlation or CFD calibration can be logged straight to handover. No number is tuned to fit, no single code is just trusted, and a solver that can't run is an honest hole, never a fabricated number; the gap is quantified and logged to handover.
15. **INTEGRATION** — the live cross-subsystem surface, in several views: a **cross-subsystem ledger** (the one place mass, CG and peak currents are declared, against shared car-level budgets/limits), **subsystem ↔ chassis CAD fit**, and **mount-point clash** — move a mount and the clash verdict plus mass/CG propagate in one call. It also **feeds the as-built numbers back into the physics**, keeps a **pending-change log**, and exports a Markdown **interface report**. Persists with the project.
16. **ELECTRONICS (PCB)** — copper-survival (IPC-2221 heating, Onderdonk fusing, IR-drop / ECU brown-out) + signal integrity (diff-pair impedance, HV-aggressor coupling), reading the **same** declared peak currents as the integration ledger so "what fires at once" is never retyped.

## Architecture-agnostic engine

The double-wishbone assumption is no longer baked in. Under the hood is a data-driven multibody kinematics kernel (`suspension/topology.py`): rigid bodies defined by points, and a small set of constraint primitives — distance links (two-force members), ball/pin coincidence, prismatic slider (strut), planar, revolute (hinge), driving DOF, rack translation and beam-axle roll — assembled into a `Mechanism` and solved by a branch-stable Levenberg–Marquardt sweep.

A library of parameterised templates (`suspension/topologies.py`) emits ready-to-solve mechanisms for every common topology, and a `from_links` builder lets you define free-form experimental corners. Every template's points — chassis pickups, free joints and wheel-carrier points alike — are **editable live in the sidebar**, grouped by role, with per-topology geometry that persists across topology switches and into the saved project; you are no longer locked to a fixed representative parameter set. An adapter (`GenericKinematics`, `suspension/adapter.py`) exposes any mechanism through the original corner-state surface, so the **same** vehicle-dynamics layer (roll-centre migration, anti-dive / anti-squat, load transfer, grip balance) drives every architecture with no changes. Instant centres and side-view swing arms are derived topology-independently from the wheel-carrier velocity field, so they're correct even for linkages that have no literal control-arm pivots.

Templates: `double_wishbone`, `macpherson_strut`, `multilink` (3/4/5-link), `trailing_arm`, `semi_trailing_arm`, `solid_axle` (Panhard or Watts), `twist_beam`, `truck_steer_linkage`, and `from_links` (experimental).

## The gap this fills

Every FSAE team makes the same suspension decisions: where to put ten hardpoints so the car gains camber in roll, doesn't bump-steer, and ends up neutral-to-mild-understeer at the limit. The tools that answer those questions well — OptimumK, ADAMS/Car, Lotus Shark — are either four-figure licenses or locked behind a sponsor. So most teams fall back to a kinematics spreadsheet that:

- solves one corner in isolation and stops at camber/toe curves,
- never connects geometry to **roll-centre migration, load transfer, and grip balance**, and
- can't be handed to a first-year without a 30-minute explanation.

KinematiK closes that loop. It runs a real 3D constraint solver for the linkage **and** a coupled vehicle-dynamics layer, so when you drag the lower rear pickup down 10 mm you immediately see what it does to the roll centre, the front/rear load-transfer split, and whether the car pushes or rotates at the limit. That coupling — geometry → kinematics → balance, live — is the thing the spreadsheets and the free web calculators don't do.

## What it computes

**Kinematics (3D constraint solver, not lookup tables)**
- Camber gain & bump steer (toe vs travel)
- Caster and kingpin inclination (KPI) through travel
- Scrub radius
- Front-view instant-centre location
- **Real motion ratio from the actual pushrod/rocker (bell-crank) geometry** — the
  pushrod drives the rocker, the installed spring length is read across it, and
  MR = spring travel / wheel travel is differentiated against wheel travel. Gives
  wheel rate = spring rate × MR², plus the full MR-vs-travel curve (rising/falling
  rate). Falls back to a clearly-labelled direct-acting proxy only when no rocker
  is defined.
- **Anti-dive and anti-squat percentages** from the side-view swing-arm geometry
  (the chassis pivot-axis inclination), referenced to the car's CG height and
  wheelbase and the brake/drive bias.

**Lap time & track (quasi-steady-state point mass)**
- Skidpad, 75 m acceleration (proper standing-start integration), and autocross
- Aero (downforce + drag), and a **real motor torque/speed map** (or the simpler flat
  power cap when you don't have the curve)
- **Track from GPS or cone coordinates** — drive/walk the course or drop the event-map
  cones and the sim runs your actual layout (`track_from_path`, `cones_to_centerline`,
  `latlon_to_xy`); no more manual segment entry
- **Racing-line optimisation** — uses the track width to straighten corners and reports
  the seconds gained vs the centreline (curvature-optimal line)

**Tire (Pacejka MF5.2 lateral, fitted to TTC data)**
- Load sensitivity, camber response, peak-mu and optimal-camber search
- **Combined slip** (Fx+Fy friction ellipse) and **relaxation length** — real physics,
  flagged uncalibrated until you supply drive/brake and transient data, so they never
  present an invented number as measured
- **Damper force–velocity model** (bilinear-digressive) with a damping-ratio diagnostic —
  the building block for the transient model, calibratable from your dyno curve
- **Structural tire co-simulation boundary** — a stateful `StructuralTireModel` contract
  (the FTire / CDTire integration *seam*), a Pacejka-backed reference backend that runs the
  whole co-sim today with no external binary, and vendor adapter stubs that declare exactly
  the binding they need. The reference backend returns `None` (never a faked number) for the
  carcass-deformation, contact-patch-pressure and tread/gas-temperature channels it cannot
  compute, and a staggered driver advances the tyre state once per macro-step around the
  transient solver — the same way ADAMS/Car couples FTire/CDTire to its multibody solver.
  See `docs/tire_cosim_interface.md` for the STI-style channel contract and
  `suspension/tire_cosim_ftire_example.py` for a runnable conforming-wrapper skeleton
- **Tire thermal channel** — a `ThermalTireModel` backend (`suspension/tire_thermal.py`)
  that fills the tread/carcass/gas-temperature and hot-pressure channels the reference
  backend leaves `None`, using a 3-node **lumped energy balance** (frictional sliding +
  rolling hysteresis in; convection to air + conduction to track out; ideal-gas pressure
  rise). The equations are textbook physics; the masses, heat-transfer coefficients and
  the optional grip-vs-temperature law μ(T) are **representative defaults, not your tyre**,
  so every thermal channel is flagged `synthesized` and `provenance().is_calibrated` stays
  `False` until you supply temperature-swept data — the same honesty gate as the friction
  ellipse and damper. It satisfies the same `step(WheelState)→TireOutput` contract, so it
  drops straight into the four-corner co-sim driver and the transient solver. Surfaced in
  the **TIRE & GRIP** tab as a warm-up / working-range / pressure view

**Electronics / custom PCB (the pre-fab electrical gate)**
- **Trace copper survival** — Onderdonk **fusing current** (does it melt), IPC-2221
  steady-state **temperature rise**, DC **resistance / IR-drop**, and an **ECU brown-out**
  check against the worst *simultaneous* load (brake light + both cooling fans at once),
  with the per-trace current rolled up from the integration ledger's declared peak currents
- **Signal integrity** — IPC-2141 edge-coupled **differential-pair impedance** vs a target
  (120 Ω CAN), and a geometric **HV-aggressor coupling** check (closest approach + coupled
  run length) so a CAN pair routed too near the switching motor-controller net is flagged,
  both owners named. Analytic *screening* only — the eye/loss/reflection that need a field
  solver are reported `None`, never faked

**Vehicle dynamics (coupled to the geometry)**
- Front/rear roll-centre heights from the solved instant centres
- **Roll stiffness derived from spring rates through the real motion ratio**
  (k_wheel = k_spring × MR², plus anti-roll-bar rate) — so a quoted spring rate
  maps to a wheel/roll rate through the actual rocker, instead of being assumed
  1:1. This is the lever the optimiser now sweeps.
- Steady-state lateral load transfer, split into geometric + elastic
- Per-tire vertical loads vs lateral g
- **Pacejka MF5.2 tire model** → load-sensitive, camber-aware grip, max lateral g,
  and an **understeer/oversteer balance index**. Ships with a sensible generic FSAE
  tire so it works out of the box, and loads a tire **fitted to your own TTC data**
  the moment you have one — see "Your tire is the edge" below.

**Flexible bodies & compliance (the rigid-link assumption, finally relaxed — NEW)**
- Every other tool here treats the control arms, pushrods and tie rods as
  infinitely stiff. They aren't: at 1.5 g the links stretch and the chassis tabs
  flex, and that shows up at the contact patch as **compliance steer** and
  **compliance camber** you never dialled in. This is the deflection a four-figure
  ADAMS Flex licence is bought for — here it's in the **◢ COMPLIANCE (FLEX)** tab.
- Resolves the **axial load in every member** (upper/lower legs, tie rod, pushrod)
  from the contact-patch wrench via a statically-determinate corner model, deflects
  each link by its **axial stiffness**, and **re-solves the kinematics** under load
  to read the toe/camber the wheel actually runs — iterated to convergence.
- Link stiffness from **tube size + material** (zero-FEA, fully defensible from
  `E·A/L`), with optional **chassis-tab stiffness in series** — usually the bigger
  real-world contributor than the tube itself.
- Or import a **real FEA mesh** of a component as a condensed flexible body: a
  beam/bar mesh KinematiK **Guyan-reduces** itself, or a **pre-reduced superelement**
  (the interface nodes + condensed stiffness an **ADAMS Flex MNF** carries). Honest
  scope: it imports the **static / constraint-mode** content that governs
  load↔deflection in a sustained corner, not the proprietary binary container or the
  dynamic normal modes — and it says so rather than faking them.
- Validated to closed form: a bar gives `E·A/L`, a cantilever `3·E·I/L³`, and a
  two-element Guyan series reduces to the exact series stiffness.

**Lap-time simulator (the number that actually wins — NEW)**
- A quasi-steady-state point-mass lap sim built **on top of the same kinematics +
  Pacejka tire + vehicle-dynamics stack** the rest of the tool uses, so every
  geometry/setup/tire change is judged in the one currency that decides events:
  **seconds**. Ships in the **◢ LAP TIME** tab.
- Runs the three timed FSAE dynamic events out of the box — skidpad (timed
  circle), 75 m acceleration, and a representative autocross/endurance lap — and
  reports per-event times plus an endurance estimate.
- Speed + lateral-g + longitudinal-g trace along the lap, and a **limit
  breakdown** (corner- vs accel- vs power- vs brake-limited %), so an underfunded
  team can see *where* time is won and aim its effort there instead of guessing.
- A **g-g-V capability envelope**: lateral/accel/braking g vs speed, showing how
  downforce raises usable grip with speed — the picture engineers use to sanity-
  check the car. (For the *full* combined envelope and the design-input sweeps,
  see the dedicated **◢ GGV DIAGRAM** tab below.)
- Point-mass layer adds power, drivetrain efficiency, traction limit, braking, and
  aero (downforce *and* the drag it costs) so wing decisions show up honestly.
- **SETUP → SECONDS** tab: re-runs the lap sim for each setup lever and ranks them
  by **lap-time gained**, not an abstract grip index — because the same 0.05 g is
  worth different time on a hairpin vs a sweeper. With one tire set, this points
  your build hours at the lever that buys the most seconds.
- Honest about method: QSS captures corner-speed limits, the accel/brake trade,
  power and downforce — the things that dominate an FSAE lap — but not transient
  yaw, combined-slip friction-circle usage, tire temperature, or the racing line.
  Trust the *ranking* firmly and the *absolute seconds* to a few percent; the UI
  says so. Robust by construction: a bad data point, a non-converging corner, or a
  pathological tire never crashes the session — the sim substitutes a safe default
  and surfaces a warning instead of raising.

**GGV diagram (the full combined-acceleration envelope — NEW)**
- The single steady-state picture an engineer reads before stepping up to full
  transient/multibody modelling: at each speed, the closed boundary in the
  (longitudinal g, lateral g) plane — cornering, braking, accelerating, and every
  combination between. Ships in the **◢ GGV DIAGRAM** tab. Where the lap sim's
  older g-g-V gave only three axis points per speed, this is the *whole* surface.
- Built **through the same load-transfer + Pacejka chain** as everything else, so
  the design inputs an FSAE team actually owns are the levers that reshape it:
  **CG height, roll-centre height, wheel/spring rate (through the real motion
  ratio), dynamic camber, weight and weight distribution, and aero ClA/CdA**.
- A built-in **design-input sweep** answers "what does changing *X* do to my
  envelope?" directly — pick CG height, weight distribution, camber, roll
  stiffness, downforce or power and see the metric move. (Camber sweeps force the
  camber lever live even with geometry attached, so a flat curve only ever means
  genuine tire insensitivity, never a silent geometry override.)
- **Combined-slip aware:** drop in a `CombinedSlipTire` and the longitudinal axis
  uses its calibrated longitudinal/lateral mu ratio while the envelope corners
  take its friction-ellipse exponents (a superellipse, not a forced circle) — the
  same object the lap sim consumes, so there's one tire model, not two.
- **Cross-checked against the lap sim:** `GGVParams.from_powertrain()` builds the
  GGV from the same `Powertrain` the lap sim uses, and `validate_against_laptime()`
  compares their axis limits directly. They agree to **under 0.1%** on lateral and
  acceleration across downforce levels; the one deliberate, *documented* exception
  (the lap sim's brake side ignores the longitudinal mu ratio) is detected and
  reported rather than hidden. The tab exposes this as a one-click check.
- Same honesty contract as the rest: envelope *shape* and its *response to setup*
  are trustworthy out of the box on the generic tire; absolute g's become real
  once you load your TTC-fitted tire. Never raises — a bad point clamps and warns,
  and inner-wheel lift at the limit is flagged as an artifact, not sold as grip.

**Transient solver (the unsteady half of the lap — NEW)**
- The thing QSS assumes away. The **◢ TRANSIENT** tab runs an explicit,
  high-frequency time-step solver that integrates the full vehicle DAE — planar
  yaw/sideslip, sprung heave/pitch/roll, four unsprung wheel-hops, and lateral
  tire relaxation — **millisecond by millisecond** (explicit RK4 @ 1 ms) on the
  *same* tire, damper and geometry the rest of the tool uses.
- It shows the behaviour a quasi-steady model structurally can't: **turn-in lag
  and yaw overshoot** (a step steer that overshoots its steady yaw then settles),
  **snap-oversteer and the countersteer that catches it** (a trailing-throttle
  slide that spins uncaught but is pulled back by a state-feedback countersteer),
  **pitch and dive** through a brake→throttle transition (the sprung mass rocking,
  the digressive damper settling it), and **kerb strikes** (the unsprung mass
  hopping at ~15–20 Hz, the contact load spiking and dropping to zero — wheel
  lift). It also contrasts the transient corner build-up against the QSS steady
  number directly (rise time, overshoot, settle).
- Honest scope, same as everywhere else: it resolves the dominant transient
  modes; longitudinal force is demanded and friction-ellipse-limited rather than
  spun up as full slip-ratio wheel states, and tire thermal state and a
  closed-loop racing line are out of scope — flagged, not faked. Use QSS for the
  lap-time number; use this for the unsteady behaviour behind it. Same
  never-crash contract: every run returns a flagged result with warnings rather
  than raising. Built on the verified `damper.py` / relaxation-length primitives
  and covered by `tests/test_transient.py` (37 checks).

**EV powertrain & energy — the architecture choice, decided in seconds (NEW)**
- KinematiK was born combustion: the lap sim carried a single `power_w` cap.
  That can't answer the expensive, hard-to-reverse question an FSAE-EV team has
  to get right *once*: **one motor + diff, two motors (axle split), or four
  hub/upright motors (full torque vectoring)?** The **EV layer**
  (`suspension/ev_powertrain.py`) runs your *live* car through all three
  architectures on the same track and ranks them in the only currencies that
  decide the EV events: **seconds and kWh**.
- It wraps the existing QSS lap sim at the one seam where architecture enters —
  corner-exit traction. The traction-limit difference is modelled from first
  principles: an **open diff** is capped by the lateral-load-unloaded inside
  driven wheel, an **axle split** shares but still has no left/right control,
  and **per-wheel torque vectoring** deploys each wheel to its own load-limit.
  That delta is the real, defensible reason TV buys lap time, and it's computed,
  not asserted.
- **Honest about what QSS can't earn:** the *yaw-moment* benefit of L/R torque
  vectoring (using a torque difference to rotate the car) is real but is a
  closed-loop control behaviour a point-mass cannot resolve — so it is reported
  as a **separate, clearly-flagged upper bound** and **never folded into the lap
  time**. Same philosophy as the CFD and FTire seams: no fabricated number to
  fill a hole.
- **Each architecture carries its own mass.** More motors + inverters weigh
  more, and that mass costs lap time, so TV must pay for its own weight before it
  shows a net gain. In the default run this is the headline: the four-motor car's
  traction edge is nearly eaten by its +16 kg, and the two-motor axle-split car
  wins on raw lap time — TV only pulls ahead once the separately-reported yaw
  benefit is counted. That trade, quantified, *is* the design-event argument.
- **Energy budget + regen + pack sizing:** integrates net tractive energy from
  the QSS speed/long-g trace through the inverter+motor efficiency, returns
  braking energy via a driven-axle-capped regen model, and tells you whether the
  pack outlasts the 22 km endurance distance — and if not, the planning-grade
  lap-time penalty of derating power to finish. Size the pack you can afford
  instead of brute-forcing it with the pack you can't.
- Make it yours by setting two dicts to your real numbers: `mass_delta_kg`
  (your motor/inverter weights) and `drive_grip_frac` (your measured/estimated
  corner-exit traction per architecture) — the comparison lives there. Same
  never-crash contract throughout; covered by `tests/test_ev_powertrain.py`
  (27 checks).

**Tire & grip (the thing that actually wins skidpad and the limit in autocross)**
- Full Magic Formula lateral model wired into the whole grip/balance stack — not a
  linear placeholder. Load sensitivity and camber response come from the curve, not
  a guess.
- A real TTC fitter: `process_ttc.py` cleans a cornering `.mat` and fits the MF5.2
  lateral coefficients, writing a private JSON you load straight into the tool.
- Grip-curve plots (μ vs load, μ vs camber) so you can read the optimal camber and
  the load-transfer cost off your actual tire.

**Lap-time simulator (the score, not the proxy)**
- Everything else reports grip at one operating point; competition is won on **lap
  time** — a transient, track-dependent integral of that grip. A funded team buys
  that integral by testing fresh rubber all year; on one tire set you predict it.
- Runs your **live** geometry, setup and tire around the **FSAE skidpad**
  (near closed-form, ~4.6–5.2 s band — sanity-check it by hand) and a
  **representative autocross**, via a quasi-steady-state point-mass model on the
  same grip envelope the rest of the tool already trusts.
- Simple, defensible longitudinal model (power/traction cap, drag, downforce,
  rolling resistance, friction-circle coupling) so straights and corner exits are
  realistic without pretending we have a motor map we don't.
- Change a hardpoint or a setup lever, re-run, read the **skidpad delta in
  seconds** — that delta is the number to defend a design decision with, and it
  pairs with the optimiser: optimise for grip, then confirm it's worth time here.
- Never crashes the session: a non-convergent linkage or a degenerate track
  returns a flagged safe default and a UI warning, not a stack trace.

**Setup optimiser (spend your one tire set wisely)**
- Sensitivity ranking: every setup knob (weight bias, CG height, roll-stiffness
  split, static camber) ranked by **grip gained per unit change** and its balance
  effect — so an underfunded team tunes the levers that matter, not the ones that
  feel important.
- A transparent coordinate search that finds the setup maximising limit grip while
  holding balance in a target window (mild understeer = fast and safe). It reports
  the trade it made and can push the result to the sidebar / decision log.

**Chassis fit & manufacturing check (load your STEP/STL)**
- Fit check: do the inboard pickups land on the frame where a bracket can mount?
- Clearance check: sweep the linkage through full travel and find the minimum
  distance from every moving link to the chassis — flags collisions before you cut tube
- 3D overlay of the swept linkage on the chassis mesh
- Export a manufacturing pickup schedule (coordinates + link lengths) for the fab team

**Multi-team integration (any subteam, any part)**
- Generic part-vs-chassis interference check: load the shared chassis once, load any
  part (caliper, radiator, battery box, wing mount, ECU tray), get collision / tight /
  clear back with the worst point highlighted
- Position parts in the shared frame with offset + rotation
- Same workflow for every Elbee subteam — aero, brakes, cooling, data-acq, electrics,
  powertrain, suspension. The idea: a team that can't out-spend its rivals wins by not
  wasting parts on rework. Catch interference in CAD before the first cut.

**Parametric mount-point clash + CG propagation (the CAD→clash→CG chain — NEW)**
- The interference checks above test a *whole loaded part* against the chassis mesh.
  This closes the faster inner loop a subteam lives in: move **one mounting hardpoint**
  a few millimetres and get, in a single call, both consequences at once —
  - **the clearance clash** against every keep-out volume another subteam's master file
    reserves (the chassis main hoop, the driver legroom box, the accumulator, a cooling
    duct), flagged as hard interference (FAIL) or inside-the-clearance-band (WARN), with
    **both subteams named as owners** so the conflict has an owner, and
  - **the updated car CG**, re-rolled through the same integration ledger the
    vehicle-dynamics model reads, so geometry and the load-transfer number can never
    drift out of sync.
- Geometry is explicit and honest: a `MountPoint` in car coordinates and a `KeepOut`
  axis-aligned box, checked with an **exact analytic point-to-box signed distance**
  (zero CAD-kernel dependency, validated to closed form). A point that legitimately
  **bolts onto** a structure is allowed to touch it; everything else it must clear.
- Provenance carries through: a point or box flagged *estimated* taints the finding as
  estimated rather than presenting placeholder geometry as final — the same
  no-false-confidence rule the rest of KinematiK keeps.
- Lives in the **◢ INTEGRATION** tab under the *Mount-point clash* view, and **persists
  with the project** (`project.json`) so the points, keep-outs and last move survive a
  restart. `update_interface_cg` opt-in shifts a subsystem's declared CG with the point
  only when that point genuinely is the part's mass location — off by default, because a
  single bracket usually isn't.

**Custom-PCB copper survival + signal integrity (the pre-fab electrical gate — NEW)**
- The same integration ledger names every subsystem's peak current and supply voltage, but
  it stops at "does the LV bus have enough headroom". This closes the inner loop the
  electrical sub-team lives in the afternoon before a board goes to fab: pick a **trace
  width** and route the **CAN differential pair**, and get, in one call, whether the board
  survives its worst moment.
- **Copper survival**, against the worst *simultaneous* load (the brake light and both
  cooling fans firing at once):
  - **Onderdonk fusing current** — the amperage at which the trace physically *melts*,
  - **IPC-2221 steady-state temperature** — does it cook past the board's derate ceiling,
  - **IR-drop / ECU brown-out** — does the voltage drop under that load pull the rail below
    the microcontroller's brown-out threshold and reset the car mid-event. A trace that
    fuses before steady state is reported as an open circuit, not merely a brown-out — the
    two findings can't physically contradict each other.
- **Signal integrity**: an **edge-coupled microstrip differential-impedance** estimate
  (IPC-2141) checked against the pair's target (120 Ω for CAN), and a **geometric coupling
  check** of every signal pair against the switching **HV motor-controller / inverter** net
  — closest approach and coupled run length — so a CAN pair routed too close to the
  high-voltage switching node is flagged with **both owners named** (electrics ↔ powertrain).
- The worst-case current per trace is **rolled up from the integration ledger's declared
  `peak_current_a`**, not retyped in the electrical tab — so "what fires at once" and what
  TEAM FIT says a subsystem draws can never drift apart.
- Honest about its limits, like the rest of KinematiK: it is an **analytic screening**
  layer, **not a PCB CAD kernel and not a field solver**. The impedance and coupling
  numbers are labelled estimates; the things that genuinely need a 2-D field solver / SPICE
  — the true eye height, insertion loss, reflection coefficient, coupled-noise waveform —
  are returned as **`None` / "not computed"** rather than invented (the same contract the
  structural-tire co-sim backend uses). The IPC temperature curve is clamped at copper's
  melting point so it can never print a non-physical number.
- Lives in the **◢ ELECTRONICS (PCB)** tab and **persists with the project** (`project.json`)
  so traces, pairs, aggressor nets and the load scenario survive a restart.

**Weight budget & handover (persistent team memory)**
- Per-team weight budget with a running total against a target mass; mass estimated
  from CAD volume + material or entered manually, with per-subteam breakdown
- TEAM FIT can push a part's CAD-estimated mass straight into the budget in one click
- Design-decision log — capture *why* a choice was made, not just what, as you go
- Interference checks auto-offer to log the problem to the decision log
- One-click handover report exported to Markdown, PDF, and JSON, bundling the
  suspension design state, weight budget, decision log, and any open cross-team items
- Everything persists to `project.json` in the project folder — commit it to the repo
  and the knowledge survives graduation instead of dying in a senior's spreadsheet

**Lead notes (cross-team comms that don't go stale)**
- Notes addressed to a specific team (or broadcast to all), with author, timestamp,
  an open/resolved status, and urgent / action-requested flags
- Open-item counts per team so a lead sees what's blocking them at a glance
- The point vs Discord: a note here is tied to the work, addressed to a team, and
  tracked until resolved — which is how you stop two finished parts not fitting

**Workflow**
- Live 3D view of the corner
- Export setup as JSON, export the travel sweep as CSV for your report plots

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> kinematik && cd kinematik
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then edit hardpoints in the sidebar (millimetres, SAE axes: **x** rearward, **y** to the right, **z** up). The default geometry is a representative front corner you can tune from.

### Sharing it with the team (tunnel testing)

Before deploying anywhere, you can let teammates use your local instance through a
tunnel. With the app running on port 8501:

```bash
# any one of these
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8501
ngrok http 8501
npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

Share the URL it prints. `.streamlit/config.toml` already disables XSRF/CORS and
raises the upload cap to 200 MB so the CAD file uploader works through the tunnel —
local testing won't reveal upload failures that only happen over a forwarded host,
so test an actual STEP upload through the tunnel before relying on it. Re-enable
XSRF protection before any real public deployment.

## Using the engine without the UI

The solver is a clean importable package — drop it into your own lap-sim or optimiser:

```python
from suspension import SuspensionKinematics, Hardpoints, VehicleDynamics, VehicleParams
from suspension import default_tire
from suspension.tiremodel import load_from_json
from suspension.setup import sensitivity, optimise

kin = SuspensionKinematics(Hardpoints.default())
print(kin.static.camber, kin.static.caster, kin.static.scrub_radius)

# Real motion ratio from the pushrod/rocker, wheel rate from a spring rate,
# and anti-dive / anti-squat from the side-view geometry:
print("motion ratio:", kin.motion_ratio(), "(real)" if kin.motion_ratio_is_real() else "(proxy)")
print("wheel rate @35 N/mm spring:", kin.wheel_rate(35.0), "N/mm")
print("anti-dive %:", kin.anti_dive_pct(cg_height=300, wheelbase=1550, brake_bias_front=0.65))

# Grip/balance on the generic default tire (works out of the box) ...
tire = default_tire()
# ... or on YOUR tire fitted from TTC data:
# tire = load_from_json("my_tire.json")

veh = VehicleDynamics(VehicleParams(), front_kin=kin, rear_kin=kin, tire=tire)
print("grip model:", veh.grip_model_name())          # "Pacejka MF5.2"
print("max lateral g:", veh.max_lateral_g())
print("balance index:", veh.balance_index(1.2)[0])    # + understeer, − oversteer

# Sweep the PHYSICAL levers (spring rates/ARB flow through the motion ratio into
# roll stiffness; sensitivity()/optimise() set use_spring_rates automatically):
for r in sensitivity(VehicleParams(), front_kin=kin, rear_kin=kin, tire=tire)["rankings"]:
    print(f"  {r['label']}: {r['d_maxg_per_step']:+.4f} g per {r['step']} {r['unit']}")

# Validate the model against a real skidpad run — earn trust by matching data:
from suspension import correlation
rep = correlation.correlate_skidpad(veh, measured_g=1.42)
print(rep.summary)                 # measured vs predicted, % error, trust verdict
print("within tolerance:", rep.overall_within_tol)
```

The GGV diagram is importable the same way — generate the full envelope, sweep a
design lever, and cross-check it against the lap sim, all from the live vehicle:

```python
from suspension.ggv import GGVGenerator, GGVParams, sweep_parameter, quick_ggv
from suspension import laptime

# One-call envelope from the headline numbers (no kinematics object needed):
res = quick_ggv(mass=280, cg_height=300, cl_a=2.5, power_w=60_000)
print("peak lateral g:", round(res.max_lat_g.max(), 2))
print("peak braking g:", round(res.max_brake_g.max(), 2))

# Or drive it from the live vehicle + the SAME Powertrain the lap sim uses, so
# the two share one source of truth (combined-slip tire flows through too):
pt  = laptime.Powertrain(power_kw=80, cla=2.6, cda=1.1, drive="rwd")
gp  = GGVParams.from_powertrain(pt)
res = GGVGenerator(veh, gp).generate()          # full (speed, direction) surface

# "What does changing X do to my envelope?" — X is any VehicleParams/GGVParams field
s = sweep_parameter(veh, gp, "cg_height", [250, 300, 350, 400],
                    speed=20.0, metric="max_lat_g")
print("max lat g vs CG height:", [round(m, 3) for m in s["metric"]])

# Earn trust the same way the skidpad does — prove the GGV agrees with the lap sim:
from suspension.ggv import validate_against_laptime
v = validate_against_laptime(veh, pt)
print("agrees within tol:", v["ok"], "| worst diff: %.2f%%" % (v["max_reldiff"] * 100))
```

The mount-point clash + CG chain is just as importable — move one hardpoint and get the
clearance clash and the new CG back in a single call:

```python
from suspension import (GeometryLedger, MountPoint, KeepOut, propagate_mount_move)
from suspension.interfaces import IntegrationLedger, SubsystemInterface

# the chassis engineer's master file reserves the main-hoop tube volume
geom = GeometryLedger()
geom.set_keepout(KeepOut("main-hoop", "chassis",
                         lo_mm=(1380, -180, 480), hi_mm=(1430, 180, 1050),
                         is_estimate=False))
# aero's rear-wing upper mount, currently clear
geom.set_point(MountPoint("rear-wing-upper-mount", xyz_mm=(1350, 120, 900),
                          owner_subsystem="aerodynamics", mounts_on="suspension",
                          min_clearance_mm=8.0, is_estimate=False))

# the vehicle-dynamics ledger (mass + CG) the load-transfer model reads
led = IntegrationLedger(target_mass_kg=230.0)
led.set(SubsystemInterface("aerodynamics", mass_kg=12.0,
                           cg_x_mm=1450, cg_y_mm=0, cg_z_mm=520, is_estimate=False))
led.set(SubsystemInterface("chassis", mass_kg=32.0,
                           cg_x_mm=820, cg_y_mm=0, cg_z_mm=300, is_estimate=False))

# aero drags the mount 60 mm rearward — clash + CG propagate in one call
res = propagate_mount_move(geom, led, "rear-wing-upper-mount", (1410, 120, 900))
print(res.summary())               # "...HARD CLASH flagged. CG moved ... mm in z."
for f in res.clash_findings:
    print(f"  [{f.severity.value.upper()}] {f.message}")
```

The PCB copper-survival + signal-integrity gate is importable the same way — size a
trace, route the CAN pair past the inverter, and check the board against the worst
simultaneous load in one call:

```python
from suspension import (Trace, DiffPair, Aggressor, BoardLedger, check_board)
from suspension.interfaces import IntegrationLedger, SubsystemInterface

# peak currents declared once, on the integration ledger (the single source of truth)
led = IntegrationLedger()
led.set(SubsystemInterface("cooling", peak_current_a=8.0, voltage_v=12.0, is_estimate=False))
led.set(SubsystemInterface("brakes",  peak_current_a=2.0, voltage_v=12.0, is_estimate=False))

board = BoardLedger(rail_nominal_v=5.0, ecu_brownout_v=4.5, ambient_c=40.0)
# the trace that feeds the ECU rail
board.set_trace(Trace("main_feed", net="lv_rail", owner_subsystem="electrics",
                      feeds="ecu", width_mm=0.15, copper_oz=1.0, length_mm=150.0,
                      is_estimate=False))
# the CAN pair, and the HV inverter net it must avoid
board.set_pair(DiffPair("CAN", owner_subsystem="electrics",
                        path_mm=[(0, 0), (60, 0)], target_z0_ohm=120.0))
board.set_aggressor(Aggressor("INV", owner_subsystem="powertrain", net="hv_inverter",
                              sw_voltage_v=400.0, edge_v_per_ns=8.0,
                              path_mm=[(0, 0.3), (60, 0.3)]))

# worst case: brake light + BOTH cooling fans at once -> 8 + 8 + 2 = 18 A on the feed
res = check_board(board, led, scenario={"main_feed": ["cooling", "cooling", "brakes"]})
print(res.summary())               # "FAIL: ... fail / ... warn / ... ok ..."
for f in res.findings:
    print(f"  [{f.severity.value.upper()}] {f.check}: {f.message}")
# the undersized feed FAILs on fusing, heating and ECU brown-out;
# the CAN pair FAILs on coupling to the 400 V inverter net.
```

## Flexible bodies & compliance (ADAMS Flex-style)

The rigid solver freezes every link length. The compliance layer relaxes that: it
finds the axial load in each member at a cornering case, lets the links stretch by
their stiffness, and re-solves the geometry under load. You get the **compliance
toe and camber** — the steer/camber the wheel runs that isn't in your kinematics.

The fastest way in is the **◢ COMPLIANCE (FLEX)** tab: pick a lateral g, a tube
size, optionally tick chassis-tab compliance, and read the deflected toe/camber and
the per-member force/deflection. From code:

```python
from suspension import (SuspensionKinematics, Hardpoints,
                        VehicleDynamics, VehicleParams)
from suspension import CompliantCorner, MemberStiffness, corner_wheel_load

hp  = Hardpoints.default()
kin = SuspensionKinematics(hp)
veh = VehicleDynamics(VehicleParams(), front_kin=kin, rear_kin=kin)

# Easiest: every link the same tube, optional chassis-tab stiffness in series.
corner = CompliantCorner.uniform_tube(hp, od_mm=19.05, wall_mm=0.9, k_tab=8000.0)

# Drive it straight off the real load-transfer model at the headline 1.5 g case:
res = veh.corner_compliance(1.5, corner=corner)     # front-outer wheel
print(f"compliance toe   {res.compliance_toe:+.3f} deg")   # the compliance steer
print(f"compliance camber{res.compliance_camber:+.3f} deg")
print("converged:", res.converged, "in", res.summary()['iterations'], "iters")
print("member forces (N):", res.member_forces)             # + tension, − compression
```

Want one link at a time? Pass a per-member stiffness map; members you omit stay
rigid, so you can isolate (say) the tie rod and watch only compliance steer move:

```python
stiff = {"TR": MemberStiffness(k_direct=1200.0)}   # N/mm; everything else rigid
res = CompliantCorner(hp, stiff).solve(
        corner_wheel_load(veh, "front", 1.5, outer=True))
```

A member's stiffness can come from three sources — a number you already have
(`k_direct`), an analytic tube (`material, od_mm, wall_mm` → `E·A/L` on the link's
length), or a condensed **FEA flex body**. Add `k_tab` to put a chassis-tab/bracket
stiffness in series with any of them.

### Non-linear joints: bushings, rod ends & spherical-bearing lash

Relaxing the link is only half the story — the rigid solver also treats every
*joint* as a perfect, zero-play constraint. Real cars don't have those. A
`JointCompliance` gives any connection its own **non-linear force-vs-displacement
curve** plus a **damping** coefficient, so you can model what's actually bolted in:

```python
from suspension import JointCompliance, CompliantCorner, corner_wheel_load

bushing  = JointCompliance.rubber_bushing()          # soft, progressive, high loss
# or .polyurethane_bushing() — stiffer, less progressive, lower loss
rod_end  = JointCompliance.spherical_bearing(lash_mm=0.05)   # micro-yield / clearance

cc  = CompliantCorner.with_bushings(hp, bushing=bushing, rod_end=rod_end)
res = cc.solve(corner_wheel_load(veh, "front", 1.5, outer=True))
print(res.compliance_toe, res.contact_patch_lateral_shift_mm)   # secondary steer, track compliance
print(res.member_joint_deflection["TR"])   # {'link':…, 'joint_in':…, 'joint_out':…} mm
```

Each joint is a non-linear spring **in series** with its link along the load line
(a pin-jointed two-force member transmits axial force through its end joints), so the
member's total give is `link + joint_in + joint_out` and feeds the same solver — the
**compliance steer** off a soft tie-rod bushing and the **track-compliance** lateral
patch shift off the wishbone joints fall straight out. Curve shapes available:
`linear`, `cubic` (progressive, the elastomer shape), `bilinear`, `freeplay` (the
lash dead-band of a worn rod end), and `tabular` for a measured rig curve. Build any
member by hand to mix them:

```python
stiff = {"TR": MemberStiffness(material="Steel 4130", od_mm=12.0, wall_mm=1.0,
                               joint_in=JointCompliance.rubber_bushing(),
                               joint_out=JointCompliance.spherical_bearing())}
```

**Where damping lives (honestly).** Damping is a rate term — it does no work in a
steady, zero-velocity corner, so it never touches the static compliance number.
It is surfaced two truthful ways: `corner.damping_summary(load, amplitude_mm, freq_hz)`
reports the hysteresis energy lost per cycle, and `corner.linearized_rates(load,
freq_hz)` exports each joint's tangent stiffness + equivalent viscous rate for the
transient DAE solver to consume. A bushing's off-axis (transverse) give carries no
load under the two-force idealisation, so it is modelled along the load line, not
fed back as geometry — stated, not hidden.

### Importing an FEA component (the "Flex" part)

A flexible body is a `.flex.json` in one of two schemas. Two ready samples ship in
[`examples/`](examples/) — a lower A-arm as a beam **mesh** and the same arm as a
**reduced** superelement.

**1. Mesh** — give nodes, beam/bar elements and the interface (attachment) nodes;
KinematiK assembles and **Guyan-condenses** it to the interface for you:

```json
{ "type": "mesh",
  "nodes": [ {"id": "lower_front_inner", "xyz": [-110, 200, 122.5]},
             {"id": "lower_ball",        "xyz": [  -5, 575, 110]} ],
  "elements": [ {"n1": "lower_front_inner", "n2": "lower_ball",
                 "kind": "beam", "material": "Steel 4130",
                 "od_mm": 25.4, "wall_mm": 1.65} ],
  "interface": { "lower_front_inner": "lower_front_inner",
                 "lower_ball": "lower_ball" } }
```

**2. Reduced** — a pre-condensed superelement: interface nodes + the condensed
stiffness matrix. This is the portable form an **ADAMS Flex MNF**, a Craig–Bampton
boundary reduction, or a DMIG export already carries; KinematiK uses it verbatim:

```json
{ "type": "reduced", "dofs_per_node": 6,
  "interface": [ {"name": "lower_front_inner", "xyz": [-110, 200, 122.5]},
                 {"name": "lower_ball",        "xyz": [  -5, 575, 110]} ],
  "K_condensed": [[ ... 12 x 12 ... ]] }
```

Load either and map its nodes onto a member:

```python
from suspension import load_flex_body
body = load_flex_body("examples/lower_a_arm.flex.json")
stiff = {"LF": MemberStiffness(flex_body=body,
                               node_out="lower_ball", node_in="lower_front_inner")}
```

**Honest scope.** A production `.mnf` is a proprietary binary holding the interface
data *and* the fixed-interface normal modes used for transient/NVH. KinematiK
imports the **static (constraint-mode) stiffness** — exactly what governs
load↔deflection in a *sustained* corner — and `read_mnf` raises a clear, actionable
error on a binary file instead of guessing. Export the reduced superelement (the
boundary stiffness) as JSON and the numbers are identical; only the packaging
differs. This is a steady-state, quasi-static compliance model: no damper dynamics,
no modal response, no kerb strikes.

## Bolted joints: will the pedal box peel off its tabs?

The link-flex layer above tells you how a member *deflects*. This layer answers a
different structural question the same honest way: **does a preloaded bolted joint
stay clamped, or does the load pry a bracket foot off the chassis?** The motivating
case is the brake pedal box — a hard panic stop puts a bending moment into the base
that tries to peel the front (or rear) edge straight off its mounting tabs, and a
naïve "force ÷ number of bolts" share badly understates what the far-edge bolt
actually sees.

`suspension/bolted_joint.py` implements the classical **VDI 2230 / Shigley** preloaded-joint
method — all closed-form, no FEA required for the part that *is* closed-form:

```python
from suspension import Fastener, ClampedStack, analyze_joint, joint_findings

# 4× M6 grade-10.9 socket-heads, lightly lubed (K=0.15), 8 mm grip,
# pedal-box base (7075) onto a 6061 chassis face, 10 mm washer face.
f = Fastener(grade="10.9", nominal_d_mm=6.0, K_factor=0.15,
             head_dia_mm=10.0, hole_dia_mm=6.4)
s = ClampedStack(base_material="Aluminium 7075",
                 chassis_material="Aluminium 6061", grip_mm=8.0)

r = analyze_joint(f, s,
                  assembly_torque_Nm=10.0,      # explicit pretension: F_i = T/(K·d)
                  external_tensile_N=900.0,     # this foot's pull-off load, braking
                  prying_factor=3.2)            # bending lever amplifying the far bolt

print(r.F_preload, r.load_factor, r.F_sep, r.separated)   # 11111 N, Φ≈0.50, 22086 N, False
print(r.separation_safety)                                # 7.67× margin to gap-opening
for finding in joint_findings(r):
    print(finding.severity.value, finding.check, finding.message)
```

What it models, and why it maps onto the contact/pretension/separation workflow a
funded team would run in Ansys:

- **Explicit bolt pretension** — torque becomes clamp force via `T = K·F·d`, with the
  nut-factor `K` exposed (≈0.20 dry, ≈0.15 lubed, ≈0.12 anti-seize) because that
  scatter is the real source of preload uncertainty, not a number to bury.
- **The joint load factor** `Φ = k_b/(k_b+k_m)` — the heart of the
  frictional/no-separation behaviour. *Below separation the bolt only feels `Φ·F_ext`
  on top of preload, so its stress barely moves*; the clamped interface absorbs the
  rest. Bolt and member stiffness come from the standard rod and Wileman/Shigley
  frustum forms, or you can hand it a **condensed FEA stiffness** for the foot
  (`k_member_N_per_mm`) straight off the flex layer.
- **The separation check** — `F_sep = F_preload/(1−Φ)`. When the external (pried) load
  exceeds it, the joint **gaps open** and the bolt instantly carries the full raw
  load — the fatigue spike. That's a `FAIL` `Finding`.
- **Washer-face bearing / crush** — checks contact pressure under the head against the
  soft base material's allowable, flagging the localized yield that relaxes preload
  and lets the joint **back out on track**.

**Honest scope — the one thing it does *not* fake.** A true frictional-contact, solid-mesh
FEA of *how* a specific base plate bows and peels needs the real meshed bracket and a
contact solver — KinematiK is beam/bar + analytic, and (like the rest of the codebase)
it refuses to fabricate FEA it can't validate, least of all a green light on a brake
component. So the prying amplification is a single, visible input (`prying_factor`)
you supply from a hand lever-arm calc or a real FEA. Any result that uses it is flagged
`is_estimate=True` and carries the factor in its `detail`, so a provisional number can
never read as final — at design judging that's the defensible position, not a black box.
Every result renders as the same typed `Finding` objects (`bolt-separation`,
`bolt-stress`, `bolt-bearing`, `bolt-prying`) the integration board already shows, with
owners named.

## Your tire is the edge

You can only afford one set of tires. A funded team tests rubber all year; you
can't. So the entire equaliser is extracting maximum truth from the tire data you
*are* allowed — the FSAE Tire Test Consortium — and making every geometry and setup
decision against it before you commit the set you bought.

```bash
# Fit a full MF5.2 lateral model to your TTC cornering file (stays local/private):
python process_ttc.py path/to/your_cornering.mat my_tire.json
```

Then upload `my_tire.json` in the **TIRE & GRIP** tab. The grip, balance, and setup
optimiser instantly run on your measured tire instead of the generic default. The
`.mat` files and the fitted `.json` are TTC-confidential and are gitignored — ship
the code, never the numbers.

## Persistent storage (so handover data survives)

By default the project memory (decisions, notes, weight budget, the mount-point /
keep-out geometry ledger, and the PCB trace / differential-pair / aggressor board)
saves to a local `project.json` file. That's fine on a
laptop, but on ephemeral hosts like Streamlit
Community Cloud the filesystem is wiped on restart — so for a deployed app the team
relies on, point it at a free hosted database.

KinematiK auto-detects [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (free Postgres). To enable it:

1. Create a free Supabase project.
2. In the SQL editor, create the table:
   ```sql
   create table kinematik_project (
     id text primary key,
     data jsonb
   );
   ```
3. Copy your project URL and a service/anon key from Supabase settings.
4. In Streamlit Cloud → your app → Settings → Secrets, add:
   ```toml
   SUPABASE_URL = "https://yourproject.supabase.co"
   SUPABASE_KEY = "your-key"
   ```
   (Locally, set the same two as environment variables.)

The app picks up the credentials automatically and switches to persistent storage —
the WEIGHT & HANDOVER tab shows a green "persistent storage" badge when it's active,
or an amber "local/session" badge when it's not. No credentials → it just uses the
local JSON file, exactly as before. Nothing breaks either way.

**Lead-note notifications follow the same backend.** Because every session polls the
shared store, real-time cross-user notification of new lead notes works whenever the
team shares one backend (Supabase). On a single laptop running the local `project.json`
there is only one session, so there is no one else to notify; if a posted note can't
be written to shared storage the poster is warned that other leads won't see it.



Each corner is a rigid double-wishbone linkage. The two ball joints must lie on the spheres defined by their wishbone lengths, the upright is rigid between them, and the tie-rod outer is rigidly tied to the upright. KinematiK drives the lower ball joint through vertical travel and solves the resulting nonlinear constraint system with a damped least-squares (Levenberg–Marquardt) step at each position. The upright's rigid pose is then transported to the wheel-centre, contact patch, and spin axis, so camber/toe/caster are read from the *actual* moving wheel rather than approximated. See `suspension/kinematics.py` — it's commented for exactly this reason.

## Validate it

Sign conventions and gains are pinned by tests:

```bash
python tests/test_kinematics.py        # kinematics sign conventions & solver
python tests/test_tiremodel.py         # tire model, TTC fitter, setup optimiser
python tests/test_ggv.py               # GGV envelope, combined slip, lap-sim cross-check
python tests/test_daq.py               # force-balance decoupling + vibration filters (offline & real-time)
python -m pytest tests/                # everything (460+ tests)
```

The tire tests pin the things the grip upgrade depends on: load sensitivity in the
right direction, the fitter recovering a known tire from noisy data, and the
optimiser never returning a setup worse than where it started.

Before you trust it for a design decision, sweep one corner against your existing
OptimumK/spreadsheet model and check the camber curve matches. If it doesn't, that's
a bug worth a GitHub issue.

## The interface that other tools don't have (SUBSYSTEM INTEGRATION tab)

OptimumK, ANSYS and SolidWorks each go deep in **one** domain. What no FSAE team has is
a place where the **interfaces between** subsystems are owned and checked — so eight
sub-teams optimise in isolation and the integration failures (the radiator that won't
fit the duct, the motor torque that exceeds the driveline, eight "~12 kg" estimates that
sum well over budget) surface at assembly or at competition, when they're expensive.

The SUBSYSTEM INTEGRATION tab (and `suspension/interfaces.py`) is a live integration
ledger. Each of the eight subsystems declares, in typed fields, what it **needs from**
the car and what it **provides to** it — mass + CG, spatial envelope, mount loads,
power draw, heat/airflow, torque, downforce. KinematiK then runs cross-subsystem
consistency checks and reports `Finding`s with a severity (`FAIL` / `WARN` / `MISSING` /
`INFO` / `OK`) that name **both** subsystems involved, so each conflict has an owner:

- mass budget vs target (net of a declared driver allowance) and combined **mass-weighted
  CG** — which is pushed straight into the vehicle model so load transfer and the lap sim
  reflect the real build, not an assumption;
- spatial **envelope fit** of each subsystem inside the chassis interior;
- **cooling airflow** required vs what the cooling package can move;
- **LV power** draw vs supply, and HV voltage match;
- **driveline torque** the powertrain delivers vs what the driveshaft/CV/upright is rated for;
- mount loads vs design loads.

Crucially it **does not simulate any subsystem** — KinematiK can't do CFD, brake-thermal,
chassis FEA or battery modelling, and faking those would be the same false-confidence trap
the rest of the codebase refuses. Each subsystem's analysis stays in the tool that does it
properly; this owns the channels between them. Every declaration carries an `is_estimate`
flag, and the board always surfaces which numbers are placeholders, so a green board never
implies more certainty than the data behind it. That coordination layer — not deeper
single-domain physics — is the edge.

**It doubles as living documentation.** Each interface carries a `rationale` ("why these
numbers"), an owner, and a last-updated stamp; every edit is auto-logged to the handover
record as it happens. `build_interface_markdown()` exports the whole contract — values,
rationale, provenance, the combined mass/CG, and the integration findings — as a
design-event-ready document, so the design justification judges ask for is captured as
the team works rather than scrambled together before the report deadline. Estimates and
checks passing on placeholder data are marked as such in the export, so the document is
honest about its own maturity.

## Correlate it against real data (the VALIDATION tab)

A sim only changes a decision if people believe it, and the honest way to earn that
is to show it predicted something you measured. The **VALIDATION** tab (and
`suspension/correlation.py`) takes data a cash-strapped team can actually collect and
reports the gap in plain, checkable numbers:

- **Skidpad** — enter your measured peak lateral g *or* timed-circle time; it reports
  the error on both channels against the live grip model. This is the cleanest case:
  steady-state and near closed-form, so a mismatch here means the grip stack is off,
  not the lap integration.
- **Acceleration (75 m)** — compares your measured run against a standing-start
  integration of the longitudinal model (`laptime.acceleration_time`).
- **Speed trace** — upload a two-column `distance, speed` CSV from GPS or a wheel-speed
  log; the sim trace is resampled onto your distance axis and compared point-for-point,
  reporting RMSE, **mean bias** (does the sim run systematically fast or slow?),
  peak-speed error, and R².

It deliberately does **not** tune the model to fit your data — it quantifies the gap
and tells you which way the model is biased, so you either trust the prediction for the
decision in front of you or go find the assumption that's wrong. Tolerances live in
`DEFAULT_TOL` in `correlation.py`; they're explicit and editable, and every report
carries the tolerance it used. A correlation can be logged straight to the handover
record so the *evidence* travels with the design decision — which is what actually
settles an argument, rather than the loudest opinion in the room.

### Virtual Tunnel Solver — calibrate your CFD against the physical aero map

The headline reason to run a wind tunnel isn't "is the car fast" — the lap sim
answers that cheaper. The reason is **CFD calibration**. A modern aero programme
screens hundreds of digital configurations before one part gets made, and that only
works if your turbulence closure (for FSAE, almost always **k-omega SST RANS**)
reproduces numbers you actually measured. The tunnel is the ruler the CFD is checked
against.

There's no single-code choice to make. The **Virtual Tunnel Solver**
(`suspension/aero/ensemble.py`, `EnsembleTunnelSolver`) is built **on Star-CCM+,
TS-Auto *and* OpenFOAM at once**. It implements the same `CFDSolver` seam every
single backend does — so it drops straight into `VirtualWindTunnel` — but instead of
*being* one code it runs each matched point through **all three** and **fuses** their
converged output into one cross-code **consensus** coefficient. The **inter-code
spread** is the payoff: two independent solvers landing on the same C_l is the
strongest cheap evidence the number is physical; the same two diverging is a red flag
no single-solver report would ever surface. That consensus — not any one code — is
what gets calibrated against the tunnel.

The **VALIDATION** tab's *Wind tunnel (CFD calibration)* mode runs that loop with one
non-negotiable rule: **compare like-for-like operating points.** You sweep the
physical aero map over front and rear ride height (downforce is exquisitely
ride-height sensitive on a ground-effect car), then the Virtual Tunnel Solver
generates the run at *those exact* front/rear ride heights and wind speed — generated
*from* the physical map, never hand-typed alongside it, so a ride-height sensitivity
can't masquerade as a turbulence-model error.

- Upload the **physical aero map** (`front_mm, rear_mm, speed_ms, c_lift, c_drag`,
  optional `aero_balance_front`; `c_lift` negative = downforce). It loads as a
  `PhysicalAeroMap` carrying **tunnel provenance** — facility, moving-ground vs
  fixed floor, blockage correction, Reynolds — because an uncorrected, fixed-floor
  reading is a *different measurement* from a corrected, moving-belt one, and the
  provenance refuses to let a correlation imply more than the run behind it. (It's
  also a drop-in `AeroMap`, so the lap sim can consume the measured map directly.)
- **Step 1** writes the matched driver files for **every code at once** — a
  **Star-CCM+** Java macro, a **TS-Auto** run config, *and* a full **OpenFOAM** case
  — one sub-folder per code under each matched point, with the same reference
  area/length the physical coefficients were normalised by. Run them on your licensed
  installs / OpenFOAM cluster (KinematiK never holds the license or fakes a solve),
  export one coeff CSV per code.
- **Step 2** uploads the results. Give each code's coefficients in per-code columns
  (`c_lift_starccm`, `c_drag_starccm`, `c_lift_tsauto`, …) and the solver **fuses**
  them: the consensus is the `mean` or `median` of the converged codes, reported as
  **converged only if** enough codes voted **and** their inter-code spread is inside
  the **agreement tolerance** — codes that disagree are flagged (a flag, not a
  number) *before* the tunnel comparison. Then it reports, **point by point and
  overall**, the C_l / C_d / balance error and whether k-omega SST is calibrated to
  the tunnel inside tolerance. A point the CFD never covered is an honest **hole**,
  never snapped to a neighbour; a real offset is flagged **NOT CALIBRATED** with the
  direction (does CFD over- or under-predict downforce, and what to check —
  floor/diffuser y+, transition, moving-ground modelling). Tolerances live in
  `DEFAULT_TUNNEL_TOL`, explicit and editable. The verdict logs to handover so the
  *evidence* that your digital pipeline is trustworthy travels with the decisions it
  justifies. (A single pre-fused `c_lift, c_drag` is still accepted if you've combined
  the codes yourself.)

The honesty contract runs all the way through the fusion: a code that cannot run is
recorded as a **hole** that contributes **nothing** — not zero, not a guess — and
with no usable code the consensus coefficient is `None`, never fabricated. Same
philosophy as the rest of the CFD seam: KinematiK owns the parameterisation, the
matched run matrix and the consensus correlation; the meshing and the Navier–Stokes
solve live outside it, on your cluster with your license.

```python
from suspension.aero import (PhysicalAeroMap, TunnelProvenance, RideHeights,
                             VirtualWindTunnel, get_backend, fused_results)

phys = PhysicalAeroMap(TunnelProvenance("A2"), reference_area_m2=1.0)
phys.add_measurement(RideHeights(20, 40, 27.0), c_lift=-2.8, c_drag=1.05)

vwt = VirtualWindTunnel(phys, "car.stl")
vts = get_backend("virtual-tunnel", reduction="mean", agreement_tol=5.0)
specs = vwt.case_specs()                 # the exact physical points, as CFD cases
for s in specs:
    vts.write_case(s, workdir)           # writes Star-CCM+ + TS-Auto + OpenFOAM each
# ... team runs every code, stages each code's coeff CSV back ...
ens = vts.solve_matrix(specs, workdir, run=False)   # fuse the codes per point
report = vwt.correlate(fused_results(ens))          # consensus vs tunnel
```


### Surface pressure taps — *where* the wing is loaded, and *where* it's stalling

The Virtual Wind Tunnel correlates the integrated **coefficients** — one C_l, one
C_d, one balance number per ride height. That answers *how much* downforce, but
never *where it comes from*, and "where" is the question a tunnel run is uniquely
able to answer. A wing makes its downforce number with the flow attached over the
whole suction surface, **or** it makes the *same* number with the leading edge
over-loaded and the trailing third already stalled and leaking — and the integral
cannot tell those two wings apart. You only find out which one you built when the
car does something the lap sim never predicted.

A tunnel run doesn't actually hand you a C_l. It hands you a wall of **raw
numbers**: a matrix of pressure-transducer voltages (one column per surface tap,
one row per sample), a load-cell force trace, and a logged wind speed. Left like
that it's unreadable. `suspension/aero/pressure_tap.py` is the reduction that makes
the run legible, in three honest stages:

- **Raw volts → C_p.** A `RawPressureScan` holds the `(n_samples × n_taps)` voltage
  matrix straight off the DAQ, plus each channel's `TapCalibration`. `to_cp()`
  applies the linear calibration, time-averages each tap (NaN-safe, so one railed
  sample can't drag the mean), subtracts the freestream static, and divides by the
  run's real dynamic pressure to get the non-dimensional pressure coefficient
  **C_p = (p − p_inf) / q**, q = ½ρV² (or the measured pitot q when it's logged —
  the pitot is what the freestream *actually* was). C_p ≈ 1 is stagnation, 0 is
  freestream, strongly **negative** is suction — and suction on the right surface is
  the downforce.
- **Mapped onto the wing.** Every tap carries its `(element, x/c, span, surface)`,
  so the resulting `CpField` reads as a wing: `chordwise()` gives the C_p(x/c) curve
  sorted leading-edge → trailing-edge, `suction_peak()` finds where the wing is
  working hardest, `normal_load_coefficient()` integrates the pressure-side-minus-
  suction-side difference to show *where along the chord* the load is, and
  `stall_indicator()` measures the pressure-recovery slope aft of the suction peak.
  A healthy surface recovers (C_p climbs back toward 0); a **stalled** one sits on a
  flat plateau because the boundary layer has detached — a thing you can see in
  C_p(x/c) and **cannot** see in C_l. That flat tail is flagged, with the slope and
  peak, so the call is auditable rather than a bare boolean.
- **RMSE vs CFD.** `correlate_cp()` pairs each measured tap to the CFD surface C_p
  with the **same tap id** — never snapped to a nearest node — and reports the
  **RMSE = √(mean (C_p_cfd − C_p_phys)²)** over the taps that genuinely paired, plus
  the bias, the worst tap, and the coverage. This is the spatial complement to the
  coefficient correlation: it can fail (CFD got the *distribution* wrong) even when
  the integrated C_l lands, because two different C_p curves integrate to the same
  force. A tap the CFD never covered, or one that reduced to a hole (uncalibrated /
  railed transducer), is reported **unpaired** and excluded from the RMSE — the
  error is never quoted over a coverage too thin to mean anything. Tolerances live
  in `DEFAULT_CP_TOL`, explicit and editable.

The honesty contract is the same as everywhere else in the package: an uncalibrated
channel, a railed transducer, and a sample window too short to average down the
turbulence are surfaced in `ScanProvenance` and reduce to NaN **holes**, never
zero-filled. Run `python demo_pressure_tap.py` for the end-to-end story — two CFD
runs that integrate to nearly the same flap C_l, where the RMSE localises the
disagreement to the exact aft-chord taps where the real flap has stalled and the
simulated one hasn't.

### The live acquisition front end — a Virtual Instrument off the balance and scanners

`pressure_tap.py` begins one step too late on purpose: it starts from a `RawPressureScan`
that has *already* appeared in memory, and `windtunnel.py` later still, from a finished
C_l/C_d. The step before either is what the test engineer actually does first — bolt the
car to an **under-floor multi-axis force balance**, skin it in hundreds of static taps
plumbed into **electronic pressure scanners** (Scanivalve ZOC/MPS, Chell nanoDAQ), and
stream all of it through a **high-speed DAQ chassis** at several kHz. What comes off that
hardware is *not* a clean force and *not* a clean C_p — it's cross-coupled bridge voltages,
hundreds of transducer channels, and, riding on everything, the fan blade-pass tone and
structural resonance. `suspension/aero/daq.py` owns that front end (the forces/pressures
analogue of PIV's rig + processor seam):

- **Connect a custom VI.** A `VirtualInstrument` binds one `ForceBalanceSpec` and one or
  more `PressureScannerSpec` to a `DAQChassis` through a pluggable backend, then on demand
  `acquire(spec)` returns clean time-averaged **raw forces** (`BalanceReading` with F_x, F_y,
  F_z + moments, each carrying its standard error) **and** a `RawPressureScan` ready for the
  `to_cp()` reduction above — the same object the rest of the package already reads. Swap the
  `SyntheticDAQ` backend (clearly flagged synthetic in its provenance, never mistakable for a
  measurement) for a real `nidaqmx` / Scanivalve-TCP / Chell driver and the *same* VI runs
  the real tunnel. With no backend bound, `OfflineDAQ` raises `DAQUnavailable` rather than
  fabricate a stream.
- **Decouple the balance honestly.** A multi-component balance is one elastic element with
  six strain-gauge bridges: a pure drag load bleeds into the lift and pitch channels through
  the flexure, so a raw F_z bridge **is not F_z** until the 6×6 **interaction matrix** is
  applied. `BalanceCalibration` holds that matrix and the wind-off zero, applies it, and —
  the honesty gate — returns a **hole** (NaN) when the matrix is missing, uncalibrated, or
  singular, never a raw channel scaled by a guess. A railed sample on any bridge NaNs the
  whole decoupled row, because the matrix mixes the axes. (A diagonal-only `identity()`
  baseline is provided precisely to *show* how much the off-diagonal cross-talk matters.)
- **Filter the fan tone before averaging — and report it.** The wind-tunnel fan stamps a
  blade-pass tone (rpm/60 × blades) and harmonics onto everything bolted to the model; a
  naive average over a window that isn't an integer number of tone periods leaves that tone
  in the mean as a **bias that looks like signal**. Two interchangeable filters strip it,
  both satisfying one `ChannelFilter.apply()` contract so either drops into the
  `AcquisitionSpec` with no change to the VI:
  - `VibrationFilter` — an **offline** FFT-domain notch + brick-wall low-pass: zero-phase, no
    settling transient, removes a tone cleanly even on a non-integer window. The right tool
    for post-run reduction of a captured window.
  - `StreamingVibrationFilter` — the **real-time** twin: a causal cascade of second-order
    sections (RBJ notch biquads per harmonic + a 4th-order Butterworth low-pass), run
    Direct-Form-II-transposed so it emits a filtered sample the instant one arrives — exactly
    what runs on the DAQ's FPGA or a LabVIEW point-by-point loop. It exposes the genuine
    streaming primitives a live rig calls (`process_sample`, `process_block`, `reset`),
    DC-preloads its state so only the AC contamination has to settle, and is honest about the
    two things causal filtering inherently costs: a **settling transient** (reported as
    `warmup_samples` and excluded from the variance bookkeeping) and **phase lag** (noted in
    the report; it does not affect the time-average the balance reading needs).

  Either way the filter never silently reshapes the signal — its `VibrationFilterReport` says
  which tones it notched and how much variance it removed, and NaN (railed) samples are
  preserved as holes, never invented through.

Every reading carries a `DAQProvenance` recording the chassis rate, the run length, whether
the stream was real or synthetic, whether it was filtered, and any dropped samples — so a
force or pressure can never imply more than the acquisition behind it (a short window or an
unfiltered run is *warned*, not hidden). Run `python demo_virtual_instrument.py` for the
end-to-end story: a balance with real cross-talk and a Scanivalve scanner, contaminated with
a 137 Hz fan tone and turbulence, where the VI recovers the known F_x/F_y/F_z (the
interaction matrix removing ~30 N of phantom lift a diagonal balance would have reported) and
the known C_p distribution — shown with both the offline and the real-time filter landing on
the same forces.

## Roadmap / good first PRs

- **Transient response** — turn-in and pitch built on the relaxation-length and damper
  primitives now in the codebase (`tiremodel.apply_relaxation_lag`, `damper.py`). This
  is the next real step up in fidelity.
- **Calibrate the data-gated models**: fit combined-slip ellipse exponents to drive/brake
  TTC runs (`CombinedSlipTire`), relaxation length to transient runs, and the damper law
  to your dyno (`DamperCurve.from_dyno_points`). The code is in and flagged uncalibrated
  until you do — that's deliberate.
- Pull-rod and decoupled (third-spring) layouts (the pushrod/rocker module in
  `suspension/kinematics.py` is the place to extend)
- Aligning-moment (Mz) from the tire data to model steering feel and self-centering
- Full minimum-time racing line (the current one is curvature-optimal; couple the speed
  solver into the offset optimisation for the true min-time line)

Recently shipped (was on this list): real pushrod/rocker **motion ratio** and
**anti-dive / anti-squat**; **GPS/cone track import**; **racing-line optimisation**;
a real **motor map**; **combined slip**, **relaxation length** and a **damper model**
(the last three implemented honestly and gated on your data); a **validation tab**
that correlates the sim against measured skidpad / accel / datalogger traces;
**flexible-body compliance** — link/tab deflection and FEA (ADAMS Flex-style)
import giving compliance steer/camber at the cornering limit; a **tyre thermal
channel** — a lumped tread/carcass/gas energy balance giving warm-up, working-range
and pressure-rise behaviour (real physics, gated uncalibrated on temperature-swept data);
and **surface pressure taps** — raw transducer voltages reduced to a non-dimensional
C_p distribution mapped onto the wing (suction peak, sectional loading, a flat-recovery
**stall** flag) and RMSE-correlated against the CFD surface tap-for-tap, the spatial
complement to the Virtual Wind Tunnel's coefficient correlation.

### A note on honesty over a green scorecard

Several of these (combined slip, relaxation length, damper, tyre thermal) *cannot* be
made quantitatively correct without test data this project doesn't ship — Fx runs, step
inputs, dyno pulls, temperature sweeps. The code implements the real physics and exposes
an `is_calibrated`/`status()` flag that stays false, with representative magnitudes,
until you supply that data. That is intentional: a model that prints a confident number
it didn't earn is worse than an honest gap, because someone freezes a design on it. The
capability is here and turns on the moment you have the data; it will not pretend in the
meantime. The tyre **thermal** channel is built on exactly these terms: it is a real
3-node energy balance (`suspension/tire_thermal.py`) that warms up, splits front/rear and
across the tread width, and raises gas pressure — but because absolute temperature is
impossible to compute without temperature-swept TTC data, every thermal channel is flagged
`synthesized` and the backend reports `THERMAL` fidelity, `is_calibrated=False`. Read its
shape (warm-up time, the camber-driven inner/outer split, the pressure rise), not its
absolute degrees, until you fit it and set `ThermalParams.calibrated`.

Demo: surface pressure taps — raw transducer volts -> C_p on the wing -> RMSE vs CFD.

`demo_virtual_windtunnel.py` correlates the integrated COEFFICIENTS; `demo_piv.py`
correlates the off-body flow FIELD. This demo does the on-surface story the run is
uniquely able to tell: it takes the raw matrix of pressure-transducer voltages a
tunnel run actually produces and turns it into a non-dimensional C_p distribution
mapped onto the wing — so you can SEE where the wing is loaded and whether it has
stalled — then RMSEs that distribution against the CFD surface, tap for tap.

The story, on a two-element front wing:
  1. Off the DAQ comes a wall of volts — one column per surface tap, one row per
     sample. KinematiK reduces it to C_p = (p - p_inf)/q against the run's real
     dynamic pressure, mapped onto each tap's (element, x/c, surface).
  2. We read the main element as a wing: its suction peak, its sectional loading,
     and — the thing the coefficient correlation cannot see — whether the suction
     surface is recovering pressure (attached) or sitting on a flat plateau
     (separated/stalled).
  3. We overlay two CFD surface scans on the SAME taps:
       A — CFD that reproduces the measured C_p  -> MATCHED (low RMSE)
       B — CFD that keeps the flap attached where the tunnel shows it stalled ->
           MISMATCHED, with the worst tap pointing right at the stalled aft chord,
           even though the two could integrate to a similar C_l.

No DAQ, no transducer, no solver needed: the raw volts are synthesised from a known
C_p distribution so you can watch the reduction recover it exactly.

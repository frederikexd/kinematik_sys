"""
Generate a self-consistent set of DEMO wind-tunnel CSV files and validate that they
load back through KinematiK's own readers (so they are real, not invented).

It produces three things into an output folder:

  1. physical_aero_map.csv
       The measured tunnel deliverable: a front/rear ride-height sweep at one wind
       speed, in the column layout `AeroMap.from_csv` reads
       (roll_deg,pitch_deg,yaw_deg,ride_height_mm,speed_ms,c_lift,c_drag,c_side,
        aero_balance_front,converged). c_lift is NEGATIVE = downforce, KinematiK's
       convention. Load it with PhysicalAeroMap / AeroMap.from_csv.

  2. fluent_runs/<case_name>_coeffs.csv   (one per ride-height point)
       The per-case ANSYS Fluent verification export, in the layout
       `FluentVerificationSolver.read_fluent_csv` / `_read_simple_coeff_csv` read
       (Cl,Cd,Cs,CmPitch,converged). NOTE the vendor convention here: Cl is
       UP-POSITIVE, so downforce shows as a POSITIVE Cl — KinematiK flips the sign on
       read. These are made ~1-2% off the tunnel so the correlation is realistic.

  3. README.txt — what each file is and how to load it.

KinematiK — DEMO WIND-TUNNEL CSV FILES
======================================

These files are a small, self-consistent example of the two CSV roles in the Virtual
Wind Tunnel workflow. They were generated by gen_windtunnel_demo_csv.py and validated
by loading them back through KinematiK's own readers.

1) physical_aero_map.csv  — THE MEASURED TUNNEL MAP
   A front/rear ride-height sweep at one wind speed ({n_pts} points). Columns:
       roll_deg,pitch_deg,yaw_deg,ride_height_mm,speed_ms,
       c_lift,c_drag,c_side,aero_balance_front,converged
   Sign convention: c_lift NEGATIVE = downforce (KinematiK convention).
   Load it:
       from suspension.aero import AeroMap
       amap = AeroMap.from_csv(open("physical_aero_map.csv").read(),
                               reference_area_m2=1.0, reference_length_m=1.55)
   (For the full tunnel-provenance object, rebuild a PhysicalAeroMap and
    add_measurement() per row — see demo_virtual_windtunnel.py.)

2) fluent_runs/<case>_coeffs.csv  — PER-CASE ANSYS FLUENT VERIFICATION EXPORTS
   One file per ride-height point, named exactly as KinematiK names the case, with
   the columns the Fluent verification deck asks you to export:
       Cl,Cd,Cs,CmPitch,converged
   Sign convention: VENDOR up-positive (Cl POSITIVE = downforce). KinematiK flips the
   sign to its own convention on read. These sit ~1.8% off the tunnel on purpose, so
   a correlation is realistic.
   Load one back against its case:
       from suspension.aero import FluentVerificationSolver, CaseSpec, Attitude
       b = FluentVerificationSolver()
       res = b.read_fluent_csv(spec, "fluent_runs")   # spec.case_name() must match

WHAT THESE ARE FOR
   The physical map is the ruler; the Fluent exports are the digital run at the SAME
   operating points. VirtualWindTunnel.correlate() pairs them like-for-like and tells
   you whether the solver reproduced the tunnel inside tolerance. See
   demo_load_windtunnel_csv.py for a runnable end-to-end load + correlate.

Demo: PIV flow-field validation — does the CFD separate where the real flow does?

`demo_virtual_windtunnel.py` checks the integrated COEFFICIENTS (C_l/C_d) against the
tunnel. This demo checks the FLOW FIELD itself, which coefficients can't see: a front
wing or undertray can hit its downforce number in CFD with attached flow and stall in
reality. PIV is how you catch that.

The story:
  1. Plan a laser-sheet capture on the car's symmetry plane (XZ), at a known
     attitude/speed, and write the acquisition plan a real rig executes. The offline
     rig refuses to fabricate frames — exactly like the CFD backends refuse to solve
     without a license.
  2. Reduce a pair of laser-pulse frames into a physical velocity field by FFT
     cross-correlation (here the frames are synthesised with a KNOWN flow that
     SEPARATES off the rear of the floor, so you can see the math recover it).
  3. Overlay that measured field on two CFD slices of the same plane:
       A — a CFD that also separates in the same place  -> FIELD MATCHES
       B — a CFD running attached over the floor         -> FIELD MISMATCH, with the
           "CFD attached where the car stalls" diagnostic and a collapsed
           separation IoU.

No laser, no camera, no solver needed: the plan is written for real and the reduction
+ correlation run on synthetic frames/fields you'd otherwise bring back from the lab
and the cluster.

Run:  python demo_piv.py

"""
Pacejka Magic Formula (MF5.2) lateral tire model.

This replaces KinematiK's linear placeholder grip model with the real Magic Formula,
evaluated from coefficients fitted to measured tire data. The EQUATIONS here are the
standard, published MF5.2 pure-lateral formulae (Pacejka, *Tyre and Vehicle Dynamics*)
— they are textbook and safe to open-source. The COEFFICIENTS are tire-specific and,
when they come from TTC data, are confidential: they load from a separate file that is
gitignored and never committed. Ship the code, not the numbers.

Scope: pure lateral force Fy as a function of slip angle, vertical load, and camber
is the fitted core. Combined slip (Fx+Fy friction-ellipse coupling) and relaxation
length are also provided (see CombinedSlipTire and relaxation_length) — implemented
with real physics but flagged uncalibrated until you supply drive/brake and transient
TTC data, so they never present an invented number as measured.

A `PacejkaLateral` exposes:
    .fy(alpha_rad, Fz_N, gamma_rad=0)  -> lateral force, N
    .mu_peak(Fz_N, gamma_rad=0)        -> peak |Fy|/Fz over slip, the grip coefficient

The second is what VehicleDynamics calls to get load-sensitive grip — so plugging this
in makes the balance/grip numbers reflect the real tire, not a straight-line guess.

#  HONESTY CONTRACT for this section
#  --------------------------------
#  The lateral model above is fitted to real TTC *cornering* runs. Combined slip
#  and relaxation length need data the cornering runs don't contain:
#    * combined slip needs DRIVE/BRAKE (Fx) data at various slip angles,
#    * relaxation length needs TRANSIENT (step-input) data, not steady-state.
#  Rather than fake those, this implements the REAL physics with explicit, visible
#  parameters and an `is_calibrated` flag that is False until you supply the data.
#  Uncalibrated, it uses the standard friction-ellipse coupling and a
#  load-scaled relaxation length from published FSAE-tyre ranges — a principled
#  approximation, clearly flagged as such — so the capability exists today and
#  becomes quantitatively trustworthy the moment you calibrate it. Nothing here
#  silently invents a number and presents it as measured.

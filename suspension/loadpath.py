"""
Suspension member load path — the axial force in every link under a wheel load.

To know how much a control arm or tie rod DEFLECTS, you first need the force it
carries. This module resolves the wheel-contact load into the axial force in each
suspension member, using the standard motorsport idealisation: every link is a
PIN-JOINTED TWO-FORCE MEMBER, so it carries load only along its own axis (e.g.
RCVD / Pashley load-path analysis). The outboard corner assembly (upright + the
instantaneously-rigid wishbones) is then a free body held by a determinate set of
those axial force lines, and a 6×6 equilibrium gives every member force at once.

MEMBERS (double wishbone, modelling each A-arm as two independent legs):
    UF, UR  upper wishbone front / rear legs   (force at the upper ball joint)
    LF, LR  lower wishbone front / rear legs   (force at the lower ball joint)
    TR      tie rod                            (force at the tie-rod outer)
    PR      pushrod                            (force at the pushrod outer)

Six members, six equilibrium equations (3 force + 3 moment) → statically determinate.
The pushrod is the member that carries the vertical/spring load path; without a
defined pushrod the vertical reaction is not uniquely determined by the five
remaining links, so a clearly-labelled vertical strut proxy is substituted and the
result is flagged, rather than returning a confidently wrong number.

SIGN CONVENTION
    Member force T > 0  ⇒ TENSION (the link is being stretched, ball joint pulled
    inboard); T < 0 ⇒ compression. The force a member exerts on the upright is
    T · û, with û the unit vector from the member's outboard point toward its
    inboard (chassis) point.

All coordinates mm, forces N, moments N·mm, in the same SAE vehicle axes as the
kinematics solver (x rear, y right, z up).

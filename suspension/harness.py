"""
Harness layer — the *physical wiring harness* in 3-D car space, the half of the
electrical job `electronics.py` deliberately does not touch.

`electronics.py` owns the copper on the *board*: a trace's width, its IPC-2221
heating, its Onderdonk fusing, the diff-pair impedance. That is the PCB. This
module owns the copper *between* boxes — the loom the electrical member lays into
the chassis the afternoon before they cut a single wire:

    1. route every individual conductor as a 3-D polyline through the same car
       coordinates the suspension mount-points and keep-outs already live in, so a
       wire that would foul a wishbone, an A-arm sweep, or the accumulator box
       shows up as a clearance FAIL on the *same* integration board a mount clash
       does — both owners named,
    2. check the two things that actually scrap a loom on the bench: a bend
       *tighter than the wire can take* (kinks the conductor, work-hardens the
       strands, breaks shielding) and a connector entry with *no strain relief*
       straight length (the wire flexes at the crimp and fatigues the contact),
    3. and then — because you want the answer *before* you cut — derive the
       manufacturing artefacts straight off the route geometry:
         * the exact CUT LENGTH of every conductor to the millimetre
           (3-D path arc-length + service loops + a standards-style bend
           allowance + strip/termination stock),
         * a 1:1 FORMBOARD: the harness unfolded flat to a 2-D nail-board layout
           that preserves every branch length exactly, the drawing a fabricator
           pins the loom out on,
         * the automated BILL OF MATERIALS (wire by gauge, connectors, contacts,
           backshells, conduit/loom tube) rolled straight out of the declared
           parts,
         * the exact COPPER MASS of every conductor and the harness mass
           *distribution* (per-branch CG and the loom's combined CG in car
           coordinates), so the harness weight and where it sits is known to the
           gram before fab.

Same honesty rules the rest of KinematiK keeps:
  * This is NOT a CAD kernel and NOT a wire-flex FEA. The route is the polyline
    the electrical team declares (or imports from the CAD centreline); we measure
    it, we do not solve cable dynamics. Anything that truly needs a flexible-body
    solver — the real sag of an unsupported run under vibration, the true
    minimum-energy drape — is returned as `None` with a stated reason, never an
    invented number.
  * Cross-section / strand data is real (AWG copper areas, insulation build), so
    resistance, voltage drop and *mass* are exact, not guessed. Where a wire
    re-uses a board net that `electronics.py` already sized, the gauge carries the
    current; we do not re-type the current here.
  * Provenance is preserved exactly like `MountPoint`/`Trace`: every `WireRun`
    and `Connector` carries who placed it and whether the route is still an
    estimate, and a finding on estimated geometry says so.

The unit the rest of the app renders is the same typed `Finding` from
`interfaces.py`, so a kinked wire or a loom fouling the accumulator lands on the
integration board next to a melted trace and a suspension clash.

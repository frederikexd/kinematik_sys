"""
Fit a full MF5.2 pure-lateral Magic Formula to measured tire data.

This is the bridge that turns raw TTC channels (slip angle, vertical load, camber,
lateral force) into the coefficient set that `tiremodel.PacejkaLateral` consumes —
so the grip/balance engine runs on YOUR tire instead of the generic default.

Why this is the competitive lever for an underfunded team
---------------------------------------------------------
You get one set of tires. You cannot test-and-iterate on rubber the way a funded
team can. So the entire edge is extracting maximum truth from the tire data you're
allowed (the FSAE Tire Test Consortium) and making every geometry/setup decision
against it BEFORE you commit the one set you can afford. A linear grip guess throws
away the load sensitivity and camber response that decide skidpad and the limit in
autocross. A fitted Magic Formula keeps them.

    raw TTC .mat  --process_ttc.load+clean-->  (SA, FZ, IA, FY) arrays
                  --fit_mf52_lateral-->        coeff dict + FNOMIN
                  --tiremodel.coeffs_to_json-> private JSON (gitignored)
                  --tiremodel.load_from_json-> live model in the tool

⚠ LICENSING: coefficients fitted from TTC data are confidential under the TTC
agreement. Write them to a gitignored file and never commit them. The fitter code
here is generic math and safe to ship; the numbers it produces are not.

The fit is a bounded nonlinear least-squares (scipy) over the pure-lateral
coefficients, seeded from the generic default so it converges from a sane start.
We fit Fy(alpha, Fz, gamma) directly against the measured points — the same
equation the live model evaluates — so what you fit is exactly what you run.

    Fit the MF5.2 pure-lateral coefficients to measured points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    SA_rad : slip angle, radians (TTC SA is degrees — convert before calling)
    FZ_N   : vertical load, newtons, positive magnitude
    FY_N   : lateral force, newtons (sign convention will be normalised internally)
    IA_rad : inclination/camber, radians. If None, assumed 0 (zero-camber fit).
    fnomin : nominal load. Defaults to the median measured |Fz| — a good FSAE choice
             since the median load is near the real operating point.
    weight_by_load : weight residuals by load so high-load points (where grip is
             scarce and decisions are made) aren't drowned by light-load samples.

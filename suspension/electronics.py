"""
Electronics / PCB layer — the copper-survival and signal-integrity chain the
integration ledger names but never closes.

`interfaces.py` owns the *interface* between subsystems: each declares a peak
current, a supply voltage, a power draw, and the LV/HV check sums those against
the bus. What it does NOT own is the thing an electrical member actually does the
afternoon before they send a board to fab: pick a trace width, route a CAN pair
past the motor-controller, and need to know, *immediately*,

    1. under the worst simultaneous load (brake-light + both cooling fans firing
       at once), does this copper trace heat past its rating — or in the limit,
       fuse — and how much voltage does it drop on the way to the ECU? A drop
       that pushes the 5 V/3.3 V rail below the microcontroller's brown-out
       threshold resets the car mid-event, and
    2. does a CAN-bus differential pair run close enough to a switching
       high-voltage net (the inverter/motor-controller trace) that injected
       noise threatens the pair — i.e. is the coupling budget blown?

This module adds exactly that, and nothing more. It is deliberately NOT a PCB CAD
kernel and NOT a full-wave field solver — the same non-goal the rest of KinematiK
keeps (it is "not a CAD kernel and not an FEA tool"). It works on explicit traces
and explicit nets the electrical team declares, runs *analytic, standards-backed*
models with zero dependencies beyond numpy:

  * trace DC resistance and voltage drop from copper geometry + temperature,
  * IPC-2221 / IPC-2152 steady-state temperature rise and the fusing
    (Onderdonk / Preece) current at which the trace physically melts,
  * a microstrip / edge-coupled differential-pair impedance estimate and a
    geometric crosstalk / noise-coupling budget between an aggressor HV net and a
    victim signal pair,

and it emits the same typed `Finding` objects the rest of the integration board
already renders, so a melted trace or a noisy CAN pair shows up in the existing UI
with both owners named — exactly the way a mount-point clash does.

Honesty rules the rest of the codebase keeps, kept here too:
  * Anything that genuinely needs a 2-D/3-D field solver — the *true* coupled-line
    SI waveform, eye diagram, reflection from a real stackup — is returned as
    `None` with a stated reason, never as an invented number. The analytic
    coupling budget is labelled an ESTIMATE / screening result, not a measured
    margin, in the same spirit as the tire co-sim backend returning `None` for
    carcass deformation it cannot compute.
  * Provenance is preserved: a `Trace`/`Net` carries who set it and whether it is
    an estimate, and a finding on placeholder geometry is flagged as such.
  * The current the trace must survive is not re-invented here when the subsystem
    already declared it — `peak_current_a` on the `SubsystemInterface` is the
    single source of truth, and a helper rolls up simultaneous loads from the
    ledger so "what fires at once" and "what the interface says it draws" can't
    drift apart.

    e.g. {"fan_pwr": ["cooling"], "brake_pwr": ["brakes"]} meaning the fan trace
    carries the cooling subsystem's peak current and the brake trace the brakes'.
    The per-subsystem current is read from the SubsystemInterface.peak_current_a on
    the integration ledger (the single source of truth), NOT re-typed here, so the
    "brake light + both fans at once" load and the declared interface can't drift.

    trace simultaneously. A subsystem with no declared peak_current_a contributes
    nothing and is silently skipped (the trace check will still flag MISSING if a
    trace ends up with no load). To find out *which* picked subsystems were
    undeclared (so the UI can name them), use `undeclared_loads()`.

# Architecture-agnostic topology engine: a general multibody kinematics kernel,
# a library of parameterised topology templates (MacPherson, multi-link,
# trailing/semi-trailing arm, solid axle, twist-beam, heavy-truck steer linkage,
# plus a free-form builder for experimental layouts), and an adapter that runs
# the whole KinematiK pipeline on any of them.

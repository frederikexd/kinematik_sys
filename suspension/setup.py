Setup sensitivity & optimisation — spend your ONE tire set wisely.

An underfunded team's edge isn't more testing, it's better decisions before the
test. This module answers the two questions that actually move you up the results
sheet when you can't iterate on rubber:

    SENSITIVITY  — of every setup/geometry knob, which one buys the most grip (or
                   fixes the balance) per unit change? Rank them so you spend your
                   limited build/tune time on the levers that matter, not the ones
                   that feel important.

    OPTIMISE     — search the high-impact knobs for the combination that maximises
                   limit grip while holding balance in a target window (mild
                   understeer is fast and safe for an FSAE driver). This is a
                   coarse, transparent grid/coordinate search — not a black box —
                   so you can see *why* it picked what it picked and sanity-check it.

Everything runs on whatever grip model VehicleDynamics is carrying: the generic
default tire, or — once you've fitted it — YOUR TTC tire. The rankings are only as
trustworthy as the tire underneath them, which is exactly why fitting your tire
first is the highest-value thing you can do.

Design choice: we perturb a *copy* of the params/geometry and rebuild the model,
so nothing mutates the live setup. Each evaluation is one max_lateral_g + one
balance call — cheap enough to sweep dozens of points interactively.

# Knobs we can sweep on VehicleParams, with a sensible step and unit label. These

# IMPORTANT: the stiffness levers are SPRING RATES (N/mm) and ARB rates, NOT an
# abstract roll stiffness. A spring rate only becomes a wheel/roll rate THROUGH the
# corner's motion ratio (k_wheel = k_spring · MR²), so with geometry attached the
# optimiser explores the parts you actually fit and the rocker geometry decides what
# they do. Sweeping roll stiffness directly (the old behaviour) silently assumed a
# motion ratio of 1 and made the spring numbers meaningless — which is exactly the
# bug this fixes.

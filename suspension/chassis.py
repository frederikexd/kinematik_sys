"""
Chassis integration: check any physical subsystem against the real chassis CAD.

This is the module that turns KinematiK from a kinematics toy into something the
team can actually gate manufacturing on. For the SUSPENSION corner — which moves —
it answers the two questions that decide whether you can cut tube and weld brackets:

    FIT       — do the inboard pickup points land on/near the chassis where a
                bracket can actually be mounted? (a pickup floating 40 mm off any
                tube is a packaging problem you want to find before fabrication)

    CLEARANCE — as the wheel moves through full bump/droop AND the steering sweeps
                lock to lock, does any moving link (wishbone, upright, tie rod,
                wheel/tire envelope) collide with or come dangerously close to the
                chassis tubes?

For every OTHER physical subsystem (powertrain, cooling, aero, brakes, electrics),
which is statically mounted rather than articulating, `envelope_fit_check` answers
the static version: does the part's bounding box sit inside the chassis interior and
clear the frame tubes where it's placed? (Data-acquisition is excluded — it's
wiring/loggers with no meaningful rigid envelope.) This is spatial fit only; it does
not simulate any subsystem, consistent with the rest of the integration layer.

The suspension clearance check is the subtle one. A static geometry can look
perfectly clear and still smash a lower wishbone into a frame tube at full bump — so
we sweep the linkage, build the swept volume of each link as a cloud of segments,
and query the minimum distance to the chassis mesh over the whole motion.

Chassis CAD comes in as STEP (converted to mesh via cascadio) or STL/OBJ/GLB
(loaded directly by trimesh). Everything is kept in the same mm SAE frame as the
kinematics module — the user is responsible for aligning the CAD origin to the
suspension origin, and we provide a manual offset to help.

Bolted-joint analysis for bracket feet — the pedal-box-base-onto-chassis check
the structures member actually needs before a hard-braking event lifts a foot off
its tabs.

WHY THIS MODULE IS *ANALYTIC* AND NOT "FEA"
-------------------------------------------
The rest of KinematiK keeps a strict non-goal: it is NOT a CAD kernel and NOT a
solid-FEA contact solver, and it refuses to fabricate results it cannot physically
defend (see flex.py, mountpoints.py). A full frictional-contact + bolt-pretension +
separation study on a real pedal-box base is a 3D solid nonlinear-contact FEA job
(Ansys Mechanical / Abaqus): it needs the actual meshed bracket, surface-to-surface
contact, and a solver. KinematiK has beam/bar elements and analytic stiffness only.
Faking that workflow on beam elements and printing a "the bolt will not separate"
green light on a BRAKE component would be exactly the false-confidence failure this
codebase exists to avoid — and the worst possible place to make it.

So this module does the part that is genuinely closed-form and standard, and is
honest about the one geometric input that truly needs a measurement or an FEA:

  * The MEMBER mechanics of a preloaded bolted joint — pretension from assembly
    torque, the joint stiffness ratio, how much of an external tensile load the bolt
    actually carries vs. how much simply unloads the clamped interface, the gap-
    opening (separation) load, and the bolt working stress — are all classical
    VDI 2230 / Shigley results. No FEA is required for these and inventing an FEA
    would not make them more correct.

  * The PRYING GEOMETRY — how a bending moment that tries to peel the front (or rear)
    edge of the base off its tabs gets reacted as a *higher* tensile force at the
    far-edge bolts than a simple "force / n_bolts" share — depends on the bracket's
    real stiffness and contact footprint. That is the genuine FEA-shaped part. We do
    NOT invent it. The user supplies a prying / load-distribution factor (a lever-arm
    ratio they can estimate by hand, read off a hand-calc, or lift from a real FEA),
    and every result that depends on it is flagged `is_estimate=True` and carries the
    factor in its detail so design judges — and the next member — can see the
    assumption rather than trusting a hidden number.

WHAT YOU GET
------------
Given a fastener spec, the clamped members, an assembly torque, and the external
load a braking event puts on the worst-loaded foot, this returns a `JointResult`
with:
    F_preload        clamp force from torque  (N)
    load_factor      Phi = k_b / (k_b + k_m), the bolt's share of external load
    F_bolt_max       peak bolt tensile force under load                       (N)
    sigma_bolt       bolt tensile stress on the stress area                   (MPa)
    F_sep            external tensile load at which the joint gaps open        (N)
    separated        bool — did the applied load exceed F_sep?
    sigma_bearing    contact pressure under the bolt-head/washer face         (MPa)
    bearing_yield    bool — does that pressure crush the base material?
plus the same typed `Finding` objects the integration board already renders, so a
marginal pedal-box mount shows up in the existing UI with an owner named.

UNITS: mm, N, MPa (N/mm²), N·mm. Consistent with the rest of KinematiK.

REFERENCES: VDI 2230 Part 1 (systematic calculation of high-duty bolted joints);
Shigley, *Mechanical Engineering Design*, bolted-joint chapter (joint constant C,
separation load, factor of safety against separation). These are the standard hand
methods; this module is a faithful, transparent implementation of them, not a

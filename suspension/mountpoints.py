"""
Geometric mount-point layer — the CAD↔clash↔CG chain the integration ledger implied
but didn't close.

`interfaces.py` owns the *interface* between subsystems: each declares a bounding-box
envelope, a mass+CG, and a peak mount load, and the checker validates fit/budget/load.
What it does NOT yet own is the thing an aero member actually does day to day: move a
single wing mounting point a few millimetres and need to know, *immediately*,

    1. does that point now clash with — or run too close to — a chassis keep-out?
       (the clearance clash in the chassis engineer's master file), and
    2. what did it do to the car's mass/CG roll-up the vehicle-dynamics ledger uses?

This module adds exactly that, and nothing more. It is deliberately NOT a CAD kernel
and NOT an FEA tool — same non-goal the rest of KinematiK keeps. It works on explicit
points and explicit keep-out boxes the subteams declare, runs an analytic
point-to-box distance (zero dependencies beyond numpy), and emits the same typed
`Finding` objects the rest of the integration board already renders, so a clash shows
up in the existing UI with both owners named.

Provenance is preserved: a `MountPoint` carries who set it and whether it's an estimate,
and a clash on placeholder geometry is flagged as such rather than presented as final.

The CG half is not re-derived here — it delegates to `IntegrationLedger.mass_rollup()`,
the single source of truth — so "move a point" and "recompute CG" can't drift apart.

"""
Driving a stateful StructuralTireModel from the transient solver.

`transient.py` evaluates the tyre as an *algebraic* block inside each RK4 substep:
it calls `self.tire.lateral.fy(...)` fresh, with no tyre memory except the slip-lag
state it integrates itself. That is correct for a stateless Pacejka, but it is
fundamentally incompatible with a stateful structural tyre, for two reasons:

  1. A structural/thermal tyre OWNS internal state (carcass nodes, gas/tread temps)
     that must advance once per real timestep, monotonically in time. RK4 evaluates
     the derivative four times per step at trial points; you must NOT advance the
     vendor tyre four times, or backwards, per logged step.
  2. The vendor model is the authority on Fz at the patch (from carcass deflection),
     whereas the RK4 tyre takes Fz as an input.

The clean, standard way to couple a stateful subsystem to an explicit ODE
integrator is a STAGGERED (co-simulation) scheme: hold the tyre forces constant as
an external input across one macro-step, advance the vehicle ODE over that step,
then advance the tyre state ONCE using the step-averaged wheel motion, and pass the
new forces to the next macro-step. That is exactly how ADAMS/Car couples FTire/CDTire
to the multibody solver. This module implements that staggered driver for KinematiK's
four corners, around the EXISTING `TransientSolver` primitives, without modifying it.

Honesty note: with the ReferenceTireModel backend the structural/thermal channels
come back None and are logged as absent — the driver does not invent them. They are
populated only when a real FTire/CDTire backend is bound.

EV powertrain & energy layer — the part an underfunded FSAE-EV team wins on.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
KinematiK was born combustion. Its lap sim (`lapsim.py`) carries a single
`power_w` cap and a `drive_grip_frac` friction-circle proxy — fine for a car
with one engine and a diff, but it cannot answer the three questions that
actually decide an FSAE-EV team's season:

  1. ARCHITECTURE  — one motor + diff, two motors (axle split), or four
     hub/upright motors (full torque vectoring)? This is an expensive,
     hard-to-reverse decision (motor count, inverter count, cost, mass,
     control complexity, rules/cost-event impact). It must be made ONCE, and
     it should be made on seconds, not vibes.

  2. ENERGY        — can the car finish the 22 km endurance event on its pack
     without derating, and if it must shed power to finish, what does that
     cost in lap time? A funded team brute-forces this with a big pack; you
     predict it and size the pack you can afford.

  3. REGEN         — how much energy does regenerative braking actually put
     back, and how does the regen torque (applied at the driven axle only)
     interact with brake balance and the anti-dive the rest of the tool models?

This module answers all three by WRAPPING the existing `LapSimulator`, not
replacing it. It reuses the verified QSS speed/grip/aero solution and adds an
architecture-aware tractive-limit model and an energy integral on top. It is
the EV analogue of how `aero/` and `tire_cosim` extend the tool at a seam.

HONEST SCOPE (same contract as the rest of KinematiK)
-----------------------------------------------------
- The *traction-limit* difference between architectures is modelled from first
  principles: an open diff is limited by the LESS-loaded driven wheel in a
  corner-exit (load transfer steals its grip), a torque-vectored car can use
  each wheel up to its own load-limited grip. That delta is real, defensible,
  and is the core reason TV buys lap time. It is computed here.
- The *yaw-moment* benefit of torque vectoring (using a left/right torque
  difference to rotate the car and reduce understeer) is REAL but is a
  closed-loop control behaviour the QSS point-mass cannot resolve. It is
  reported as a SEPARATE, clearly-flagged upper-bound estimate — never folded
  silently into the lap time. We will not fake a number QSS can't earn.
- Energy is integrated from the QSS power demand (tractive power + drag +
  rolling, minus regen capture). Thermal derate of the pack/motors over a long
  run is modelled as a simple energy-fraction trigger, flagged as a planning
  estimate, not a validated battery model.

Never raises. Every entry point returns a result object with `.warnings`,
mirroring `lapsim.LapResult`.

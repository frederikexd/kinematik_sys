"""
Subsystem interface ledger — the integration layer FSAE teams actually lack.

OptimumK, ANSYS and SolidWorks each go deep in ONE domain. What no team has is the
thing the eight subsystem channels in Discord imply: a place where the *interfaces
between* subsystems are owned and checked. Eight sub-teams each optimise in their own
tool, hand off a CAD file or a number, and the integration failures surface at
assembly or at competition — the radiator that doesn't fit the duct aero reserved,
the motor torque that exceeds what the upright was designed for, the eight "we're
~12 kg" estimates that sum to 18 kg over the number suspension used for load transfer.

This module is that ledger. Each subsystem declares, in typed fields:
    * what it NEEDS from the rest of the car (envelope, mounting points, supply
      current, cooling airflow, mass budget…), and
    * what it PROVIDES to the rest of the car (mass + CG, loads into mounts, heat
      rejected, power drawn, downforce/drag…).

The checker then validates consistency ACROSS declarations and, where the physics
already exists in KinematiK, against it: every subsystem's mass+CG flows into the
real load-transfer / lap-time engine, and mounting loads come from the kinematic
solver. The rest are constraint checks — fit, budget, current, heat, consistency.

DELIBERATE NON-GOAL: this does not simulate any subsystem. KinematiK cannot do CFD,
brake-thermal, chassis FEA or battery modelling, and faking those would be the exact
false-confidence failure the rest of the codebase refuses. Each subsystem's analysis
stays in the tool that does it properly; KinematiK owns the channels between them, and
flags every input whose value is a placeholder rather than a real number, so a green
board never means more than the data behind it.

Every check returns a structured Finding with a severity and a plain-language message
naming BOTH subsystems involved, so the conflict has an owner.

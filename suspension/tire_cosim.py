Structural tire co-simulation boundary — the seam where FTire / CDTire plug in.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before adding a backend)
----------------------------------------------------------
`tiremodel.py` gives KinematiK a *stateless force law*: call `fy(alpha, Fz, gamma)`
and a force comes back instantly, the same answer every time for the same inputs.
The whole tool is built on that contract — `dynamics._corner_force`, the QSS
`lapsim`, and the RK4 `transient` solver all treat the tyre as an algebraic block
re-evaluated from scratch each step. The only tyre *state* anywhere is the lagged
slip angle, and `transient.py` integrates that itself.

FTire (cosin) and CDTire (Fraunhofer) are a different animal entirely. They are
*stateful, structural* models: the carcass deformation, the contact-patch pressure
distribution, the inflation-gas temperature and the per-element tread temperature
are INTERNAL STATE THE TYRE MODEL OWNS and integrates over time. You don't ask
FTire "what's the force at this slip angle"; you hand it a wheel-centre motion and
a 3D road over a timestep, and it returns forces PLUS an evolved internal state.
They run at 1–10+ kHz, ship as compiled commercial libraries with their own
solvers and a fitted parameter file, and there is no open-source build to call.

So integration is NOT "swap in a better fy()". It is defining a co-simulation
boundary the transient solver can drive, and being honest that the structural and
thermal physics live OUTSIDE KinematiK, inside a licensed binary fitted to a real
tyre. This module is that boundary:

    * `StructuralTireModel`  — the Protocol every backend implements (the contract),
    * `WheelState` / `TireOutput` — the per-step exchange across the boundary,
    * `TireProvenance`       — where the parameters came from and what's trustworthy,
    * `ReferenceTireModel`   — a backend that wraps the EXISTING Pacejka so the whole
                               co-sim machinery is testable today, with NO backend
                               binary, while refusing to invent the structural and
                               thermal channels it cannot compute,
    * `FTireModel` / `CDTireModel` — adapter stubs that declare the exact binary API
                               they need and raise a clear, actionable error until a
                               license + parameter file is wired in.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (why it is strict here, specifically)
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the part that makes the layer *recreate* ADAMS/Car rather than cosplay it.
ADAMS/Car's value with FTire/CDTire is a VALIDATED pipeline: the tyre parameters
were fitted by the vendor to physical rig data, and the co-sim is contracted to be
faithful to that file. The trust lives in PROVENANCE. A structural model that emits
a detailed 3D pressure field and a tread-temperature map from unvalidated defaults
is *more* dangerous than a single mu number, because the output looks like
measurement and nobody questions it — the exact false-confidence failure the rest
of this codebase (see `interfaces.py`) refuses.

Therefore, by construction:
  - Every output channel carries whether it is MEASURED-backend-derived or a
    placeholder, via `TireOutput.synthesized` and the model's `provenance`.
  - The reference backend returns `None` for carcass deformation, contact-patch
    pressure and tread temperature rather than a plausible-looking number. It does
    not have a structural mesh or a thermal network; it says so, it does not fake
    one. Code that needs those channels checks for `None` and degrades honestly.
  - `is_calibrated` is False for any backend running on anything other than a
    vendor parameter file fitted to the actual tyre, mirroring `DamperCurve` and
    `CombinedSlipTire`.

DELIBERATE NON-GOAL: this module does not implement a structural tyre model. Writing
a fake FTire would be the failure above. It owns the SEAM — a clean, typed, tested
protocol — so that a real binary drops in at one place, and so the transient solver
can be written against the stateful contract now.

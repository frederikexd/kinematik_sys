"""
Damper (shock) force–velocity model.

A damper produces force as a function of shaft VELOCITY, not position — that is what
makes it a damper and not a spring. FSAE dampers are typically digressive: a steep
low-speed slope (which controls body motions — roll, pitch, dive) that transitions at
a "knee" velocity to a shallower high-speed slope (which controls wheel motions over
bumps/kerbs). Bump (compression) and rebound (extension) are tuned independently.

HONESTY CONTRACT (same as the tyre combined-slip section)
---------------------------------------------------------
A quantitative damper model needs YOUR damper's dyno data — a force/velocity plot per
click setting. We do NOT have it and will not fake specific curves. This module
implements the real bilinear-digressive force law with explicit, visible coefficients
and an `is_calibrated` flag that stays False until you load dyno points. Uncalibrated,
the defaults are representative FSAE magnitudes (clearly flagged), so the model and the
critical-damping diagnostics work today and become trustworthy the moment you calibrate.

This is the building block for the transient model on the roadmap (turn-in, pitch,
kerb response). It is exposed and tested as a standalone primitive so that the
transient layer is built on a verified force law rather than an ad-hoc one.

Convention: shaft velocity v > 0 in compression (bump), v < 0 in extension (rebound).
Force returned with the same sign convention (resists motion).

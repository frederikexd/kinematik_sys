"""
Compliant kinematics — what the wheel actually does once the links can flex.

This is the module that breaks the rigid-body assumption. It couples three things
the rest of the tool already has, in a loop:

    geometry  →  member loads  →  deflections  →  geometry  →  …

  1. the rigid kinematic solver (kinematics.py) gives the corner geometry;
  2. the load-path solver (loadpath.py) resolves the contact-patch cornering load
     into the axial force in every link;
  3. each link's COMPLIANCE (flex.py — analytic E·A/L, or a condensed FEA body)
     turns that force into a length change;
  4. those length changes are fed back into the solver, which re-solves the loaded
     geometry. Because the deflected geometry slightly changes the member loads, the
     loop is iterated to convergence (usually 2–4 steps; deflections are sub-mm to a
     few mm and the load redistribution is small).

The output is the thing a rigid tool cannot give: the COMPLIANCE STEER (toe change
under load) and COMPLIANCE CAMBER (camber change under load) the car develops at a
given cornering load — e.g. how much toe the front axle loses to link and tab flex
at 1.5 g. That is a primary reason a real car doesn't behave like its kinematics
spreadsheet, and the number teams need when the car tramlines under brakes or the
balance moves with load.

Honest about scope: this is a QUASI-STATIC compliance analysis at one load case
(steady-state cornering load), built on the same idealisations as the load-path
solver (pin-jointed two-force members, axial compliance as the dominant term). It is
not a transient/NVH analysis and does not pretend to be.

    Axial stiffness source for one suspension member (N/mm).

      k_direct  : a stiffness value you already have (N/mm);
      (material, od_mm, wall_mm) : analytic tube, k = E·A/L on the link's length;
      flex_body + (node_out, node_in) : a condensed FEA body (flex.py), using its
        real axial give between the two attachment nodes.

    Optionally add `k_tab` (N/mm), a chassis-tab/bracket stiffness in SERIES with the
    link (the mount flexes too): 1/k_total = 1/k_link + 1/k_tab.

      joint_out : the outboard joint — typically a spherical bearing / rod end.

"""
Lumped-parameter tire thermal channel for the co-simulation boundary.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before trusting a number it produces)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
`tire_cosim.py` is deliberately blunt about it: the ReferenceTireModel returns
`None` for tread/gas temperature, because a Pacejka force law has no thermal
network and inventing a temperature "looks like measurement and nobody questions
it" — the exact false-confidence failure the rest of the repo refuses. That is the
right default. It also leaves a real hole: KinematiK could not say *anything* about
how the tyre heats up over a lap, so every grip number is implicitly a single-
temperature snapshot, and the user has no way to reason about warm-up, thermal
degradation into a long run, or the front/rear temperature split that decides
balance late in a stint.

This module fills that hole the only honest way it can: with a TRANSPARENT,
first-principles **lumped thermal network** — not a fabricated lookup, not a
vendor surrogate. Three thermal masses per tyre (surface tread band(s), bulk
carcass, inflation gas) exchange energy through:

    * frictional heat generation at the contact patch  Q_fric = |F_slip · v_slip|
      (the sliding component of the tyre force times the sliding velocity),
    * cyclic/rolling-resistance hysteresis heating       Q_roll = My·omega-class loss,
    * conduction tread -> carcass and carcass -> gas,
    * forced convection tread -> air (speed-dependent h) and to the track surface,
    * the ideal-gas pressure rise from the gas-temperature change.

Every term is a textbook energy balance. The EQUATIONS are safe and physical. What
is NOT safe — and what makes this an UNCALIBRATED channel, flagged on every sample
in `TireOutput.synthesized` exactly like `CombinedSlipTire` flags its ellipse — is
the PARAMETERS: the masses, specific heats, the convection coefficients, the
contact-conduction coefficient to the track, and above all the grip-vs-temperature
law mu(T). Those cannot be known without **empirical, temperature-swept tyre data**
(a TTC run sweeping inflation/temperature, or a vendor thermal file). Without that
data the model gives you the right SHAPE — it warms up, it saturates, fronts and
rears diverge, a long run cooks the surface — with representative-but-invented
magnitudes. That is genuinely useful for relative setup work and completely unsafe
as an absolute temperature, and this module says so, loudly, in `provenance()`,
in `warnings()`, and per-channel.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT, APPLIED
-----------------------------
  * `ThermalTireModel` is a real `StructuralTireModel` backend (it satisfies the
    same `step(WheelState)->TireOutput` protocol), so it drops into the existing
    co-sim driver, the transient solver, and the four-corner set with no new wiring.
  * It DOES compute and return `tread_temp_c`, `carcass_temp_c`, `gas_temp_c`,
    `inflation_pressure_pa` — from the network above, integrated per step.
  * It puts EVERY one of those channel names in `TireOutput.synthesized` unless it
    was built from a calibrated thermal parameter set (`ThermalParams.calibrated`,
    default False). Synthesized here means "physically-shaped, parametrically
    invented" — the same status the rest of the repo uses for the friction ellipse.
  * `provenance().fidelity` is `TireFidelity.THERMAL`, and `is_calibrated` is False
    unless you pass a parameter set fitted to temperature-swept data.
  * The OPTIONAL grip feedback — letting the modelled temperature scale Pacejka
    grip through `mu(T)` — is OFF by default, and when on it adds `"mu_thermal"` to
    `synthesized`, because the mu(T) curve is the single most data-hungry, most
    abusable part: a plausible-looking warm-up grip gain with no measured peak
    temperature behind it is worse than no curve at all.

DELIBERATE NON-GOAL: this is not FTire/CDTire's thermal module. It is a 3-node
lumped network, not a per-element tread map over a structural belt. Where FTire
gives a calibrated finite-element temperature field, this gives a defensible
warm-up curve whose absolute level you must not trust until you calibrate it. The
FTire/CDTire seam in `tire_cosim.py` remains the place a calibrated thermal field
plugs in; this module is what KinematiK can honestly compute on its own.

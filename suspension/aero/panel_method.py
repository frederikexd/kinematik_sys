Higher-fidelity in-house aero: a 3D source-panel (boundary-element) potential-flow
solver with a ground plane, run on the team's actual STL geometry.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before trusting its numbers)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The default in-house backend (`ReferenceAeroModel`) is an analytic SURROGATE: a
handful of FSAE-plausible sensitivities curve-fitted to attitude. It is honest about
being a stand-in, but its coefficients come from the fit, not from the car's shape —
change the geometry and the numbers do not move. That is fine for plumbing and
trends, useless for "does this new floor make more downforce".

This module is the genuine fidelity step between that surrogate and an external RANS
solve. It SOLVES a flow on the real surface mesh:

  * It reads the STL (via trimesh), places the car at the requested attitude
    (yaw/pitch fold into the onset flow; roll + ride height move the body over the
    road), and treats each triangle as a constant-strength SOURCE panel.
  * It enforces flow tangency (zero normal velocity) on every panel, giving a dense
    linear system A·sigma = -Vinf·n that is solved once per attitude.
  * GROUND EFFECT is modelled correctly, not tuned: an IMAGE of every panel is
    reflected through the road plane (z=0), so the road is an exact streamline. Lower
    the car and the image interaction strengthens — ground effect emerges from the
    physics, it is not a `ride_ground_gain` constant.
  * Surface pressure comes from the computed tangential velocity through Bernoulli
    (Cp = 1 - (V/Vinf)^2). Lift and the pressure (form) part of drag are the surface
    integral of Cp·n. A flat-plate turbulent SKIN-FRICTION estimate is added so total
    C_d is realistic rather than the near-zero a pure potential solve would give.

WHAT IT RESOLVES — AND WHAT IT HONESTLY DOES NOT
------------------------------------------------
Potential flow is inviscid and attached by assumption. So this method captures, from
geometry: ground effect, the pressure field of attached flow, the downforce trend
with rake and ride height, and induced effects. It does NOT capture viscous
SEPARATION, a real turbulent wake, stall, or vortex shedding — exactly the things a
RANS/DES solve and the written ANSYS Fluent deck exist to check. Its fidelity is
therefore labelled `POTENTIAL` (a resolved potential field, well above the analytic
surrogate, well below RANS), and `is_correlated=False`. The provenance says all of
this on every result. Trust deltas between geometries far more than absolute levels,
and correlate against the tunnel/Fluent before reporting an absolute number.

DELIBERATE NON-GOALS: no meshing of a volume, no Navier–Stokes, no turbulence model.
It is a surface BEM on the geometry the team already supplies, sized to run in
seconds so a sweep is interactive.

"""
Submission seam — where the run matrix meets compute.

A 20–50M-cell case is not something a Streamlit process runs in-band; it goes to a
cluster. This module separates WHAT to run (the CaseSpec list, from the solver
backend) from WHERE to run it (a Submitter). Two submitters ship:

  * `LocalSubmitter`  — runs cases in-process, sequentially. Only sane for the
    reference backend or a genuinely tiny OpenFOAM case; it is what the tests use.
  * `SlurmSSHSubmitter` — an HONEST STUB. It generates a correct sbatch script and
    documents the rsync+ssh round-trip, but does not silently pretend to have a
    cluster: with no SSH target configured it raises, with one configured it shells
    out to ssh/rsync/sbatch. KinematiK submits; the cluster (the team's, with their
    solver license) does the work.

The point mirrors the rest of the codebase: own the seam cleanly, never fake the
expensive thing on the other side of it.

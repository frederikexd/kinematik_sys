Data acquisition — the live SEAM between a wind-tunnel run and the raw numbers
KinematiK already knows how to read.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before using it)
---------------------------------------------------
`pressure_tap.py` begins one step too late on purpose. Its docstring says it
"does not talk to a DAQ, does not own a transducer" and starts from a finished
`RawPressureScan` — a matrix of volts that has somehow already appeared in memory.
`windtunnel.py` begins later still, from a finished C_l/C_d. Neither answers the
question a real test engineer faces first: the car is bolted to a six-component
under-floor force balance and skinned with hundreds of static pressure taps plumbed
into electronic pressure scanners (Scanivalve ZOC/MPS, Chell nanoDAQ), all of it
streamed through a high-speed DAQ chassis at several kHz. What comes off that
hardware is NOT a clean force and NOT a clean C_p. It is:

    * six bridge-voltage channels from the balance, mechanically CROSS-COUPLED — a
      pure drag load leaks into the lift and side channels through the flexure, so a
      raw F_z channel is not F_z until the balance interaction matrix is applied;
    * hundreds of transducer-voltage channels from the scanners, each on its own
      calibration; and
    * riding on ALL of it, the wind-tunnel fan's blade-pass tone and the model/
      sting structural resonances — a periodic vibration that a naive average does
      not remove, because the run is never quite an integer number of fan periods
      long, so the tone leaks into the mean as a bias.

This module owns that front end. It is the analogue of PIV's `PIVRig`/`PIVProcessor`
seam, applied to forces and pressures: a typed description of the chassis, the
balance, and the scanners (the SEAM a real `nidaqmx`/Scanivalve/Chell driver plugs
into) and the signal MATH (interaction-matrix decoupling, fan-tone notch + anti-
alias / vibration low-pass, and honest time-averaging) that turns the raw streams
into the clean, time-averaged `BalanceReading` (F_x, F_y, F_z) and the
`RawPressureScan` (P_static per tap) that the rest of the aero package consumes.

A "virtual instrument" (VI) in the LabVIEW/test-floor sense is exactly the small
object at the end of this file: `VirtualInstrument` binds one balance + one or more
scanners to a `DAQChassis`, runs an `AcquisitionSpec`, and streams reduced readings.
Swap the synthetic backend for a real driver and the SAME VI runs the real tunnel.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (identical discipline to cfd.py / windtunnel.py / pressure_tap.py)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A reduced force looks authoritative the instant it has a unit on it, and a quietly
mis-decoupled or under-filtered force lies with the full authority of a load cell.
So, by construction:

  * A balance with no interaction matrix, or a singular one, does not produce a
    force — it produces a HOLE (NaN), never a raw channel scaled by a guess. The
    interaction matrix is recorded with the reading; a force decoupled by an
    identity matrix is a different measurement from one decoupled by a calibrated
    matrix, and the provenance says so.
  * The vibration filter REPORTS what it removed — which tones, how much power, how
    much of the band — it never silently reshapes the signal. A notch placed where
    no tone exists is logged as removing ~nothing; a run too short to resolve the
    fan tone is flagged, because you cannot notch a frequency you cannot see.
  * A channel that railed, a chassis that dropped samples, or a window too short to
    average down turbulence/vibration is a hole or a warning, never filled.
  * No backend invents a sample. `OfflineDAQ` raises `DAQUnavailable` rather than
    fabricate a stream; the synthetic backend is clearly labelled synthetic in its
    provenance so a number it produced can never be mistaken for a measured one.

DELIBERATE NON-GOALS: this module does not own a vendor driver, does not solve
Navier-Stokes, and does not non-dimensionalise (that is `pressure_tap.to_cp` and the
coefficient reductions downstream). It owns the seam and the signal processing, so
the whole front end is writable and testable now, on synthetic streams, against no
hardware.

#
# A multi-component balance is a single elastic element with six strain-gauge
# bridges on it. Load it with a PURE drag force and you do not see voltage on the
# drag bridge alone — the flexure deflects in a way that bleeds a little signal into
# the lift and pitch bridges too. So the map from the six bridge voltages to the six
# loads is a full 6x6 matrix C (the "interaction" or "calibration" matrix), found by
# loading the balance one component at a time on a calibration rig:
#
#       load_vector (6,)  =  C (6x6)  @  (bridge_volts - zero_volts) (6,)
#
# The off-diagonal terms of C are the cross-talk. Using only the diagonal (treating
# each bridge as if it read its own axis) is the single most common way a student rig
# reports a confidently wrong side force. This dataclass holds C and the wind-off
# zero, applies it honestly, and refuses (NaN) when C is missing or singular.

#
# The FFT filter above needs the whole window in hand before it can produce a single
# clean sample — fine for post-run reduction, useless for a live VI that must put a
# filtered value on a strip chart the instant the chassis clocks one in. The real-
# time form is a cascade of second-order sections (biquads): each known tone gets an
# RBJ notch biquad, and the aero-band low-pass is a Butterworth pair, all run in
# Direct-Form-II-transposed so each section carries two state words and updates in a
# handful of multiply-adds per sample. That is exactly what runs on the DAQ's FPGA /
# in the LabVIEW point-by-point loop.
#
# Two honest differences from the FFT form, both inherent to causal real-time
# filtering and both surfaced rather than hidden:
#   * It has a SETTLING TRANSIENT: the state words start at zero, so the first ~few
#     time-constants of output are wrong. `warmup_samples` is reported, and `apply`
#     excludes that transient from the variance bookkeeping so the report describes
#     the steady-state filter, not the turn-on.
#   * It has PHASE LAG (it is causal — it cannot use future samples). This does not
#     affect the time-AVERAGE the balance reading needs, which is the quantity that
#     matters here, but it is noted so nobody reads the streamed waveform as zero-
#     phase. (Run the cascade forward then backward for zero phase if a waveform,
#     not a mean, is the deliverable — at the cost of being offline again.)

    electronic pressure scanners to a high-speed DAQ chassis through a backend, then

    time-averages everything, and hands back clean RAW forces (`BalanceReading`) and a

    both) as many times as the run plan needs. Swap `backend=SyntheticDAQ(...)` for a
    real `nidaqmx`/Scanivalve/Chell backend and the SAME calls drive the real tunnel.

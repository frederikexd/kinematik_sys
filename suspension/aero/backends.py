"""
CFD backends for the aero co-sim boundary defined in `cfd.py`.

  * `ReferenceAeroModel` — a runnable backend with NO external solver. It wraps a
    transparent analytic attitude model (a smooth, physically-shaped response of
    C_L/C_D/C_side to roll/pitch/yaw/ride-height) so the ENTIRE orchestration, map
    assembly and lap-sim coupling can be exercised and unit-tested today. It is
    labelled `POTENTIAL` fidelity and `is_correlated=False`, and it says loudly that
    it is a stand-in, not a Navier–Stokes solve. This is the aero analogue of
    `ReferenceTireModel`.

  * `FluentVerificationSolver` — the DEFAULT path of the Virtual (Wind) Tunnel. It
    is self-contained: KinematiK computes the aero coefficients INTERNALLY (it wraps
    the same analytic attitude model as `ReferenceAeroModel`), so the user needs NO
    ANSYS Fluent license, no mesh, and no external solver to get a usable answer. At
    the same time, for every case it ALWAYS writes a complete, ready-to-run ANSYS
    Fluent journal (.jou) so the user can independently VERIFY the internal number
    on their own licensed Fluent install whenever they want. The journal is a
    verification artefact, not a prerequisite. Provenance shouts that the headline
    number is an in-house analytic estimate, not a Navier–Stokes solve, and that the
    Fluent deck is provided for confirmation.

  * `OpenFOAMSolver` — a REAL adapter, kept for teams who want to drive a true RANS
    solve themselves. It writes a valid OpenFOAM case (controlDict with a
    forceCoeffs function object, the freestream/attitude as a rotated inlet
    velocity), can invoke `simpleFoam` when OpenFOAM is on PATH, and parses
    postProcessing/forceCoeffs output back into a CoeffResult. With no OpenFOAM
    install it still writes the case and raises SolverUnavailable from run_case.

  * `FluentSolver` / `StarCCMSolver` / `TSAutoSolver` — honest external-solver stubs,
    kept for teams that prefer to run a real licensed solve rather than the in-house
    estimate. They emit a correct driver file (a Fluent journal / STAR-CCM+ Java
    macro / TS-Auto config) that a team runs on their own licensed install, and raise
    SolverUnavailable from run_case until that license and a results path are wired
    in. They NEVER return a fabricated CoeffResult. These are no longer part of the
    default Virtual Tunnel path — that path is now the self-contained
    `FluentVerificationSolver`.

#  Fluent verification backend — the self-contained default of the Virtual Tunnel

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
class FluentVerificationSolver:
    """
    The default Virtual (Wind) Tunnel backend, and the one that makes the feature
    usable with NOTHING installed.

    Two jobs, kept deliberately separate so the second never blocks the first:

      1. ANSWER IN-HOUSE.  KinematiK computes the aero coefficients itself, with no
         ANSYS Fluent, license, mesh or external solver needed. Two fidelity levels
         are available via `method`:

           * "panel"    — a 3D source-panel (boundary-element) potential-flow solve
                          on the team's ACTUAL STL, with a ground-image plane. The
                          pressure field, ground effect and downforce trend come from
                          the geometry, not a curve fit, so geometry deltas are
                          meaningful. Inviscid: no separation/stall/wake (that is what
                          the Fluent deck checks). This is the higher-fidelity path.
           * "analytic" — the transparent analytic attitude surrogate
                          (`ReferenceAeroModel`): instant, geometry-insensitive, for
                          plumbing and trends.
           * "auto"     — (default) try the panel solve on the supplied geometry; if
                          there is no usable STL (or trimesh is missing), fall back to
                          the analytic surrogate, recording WHY in the result notes.

         Either way the user gets a number back from `run_case` with nothing installed.

      2. WRITE A FLUENT DECK TO VERIFY.  For every case it ALSO writes a complete,
         ready-to-run ANSYS Fluent journal (`<case>.jou`) with the freestream vector
         (yaw/pitch folded in), reference values and a coefficient-report/export
         block. That deck is the user's independent check: run it on a licensed
         Fluent install when you want to confirm the in-house number. It is a
         verification artefact, never a prerequisite.

    HONESTY CONTRACT.  The headline coefficient is labelled exactly for what it is —
    a potential-flow / analytic in-house estimate at `POTENTIAL` fidelity,
    `is_correlated=False` — not a Navier–Stokes solve, and the provenance/notes say
    so on every result, including which method actually produced it. The Fluent
    journal is generated for confirmation; KinematiK does not launch Fluent and never
    reads back a Fluent number unless you point it at one via `read_fluent_csv`.
    Nothing is fabricated: the estimate is openly an estimate.

    Why Fluent specifically: it is the single solver the verification deck targets,
    replacing the old Star-CCM+ / TS-Auto / OpenFOAM multi-code generation. One code,
    one deck, and a number you already have before you ever open it.

    TotalSim TS-Auto adapter STUB. TS-Auto is a productised automotive aero workflow
    built on an OpenFOAM core, run on the vendor's / team's licensed install. Same
    discipline as the STAR-CCM+ and Fluent stubs: KinematiK writes a faithful run
    descriptor (a JSON/YAML-style config the TS-Auto launcher consumes, with the
    attitude folded into the inlet vector and the reference values made explicit),
    and raises SolverUnavailable from run_case rather than inventing a coefficient.
    read_result parses the coefficient CSV the workflow exports.

    This is the second solver the wind-tunnel correlation path targets (alongside
    STAR-CCM+): a team maps the physical aero map, then runs the IDENTICAL ride-
    height/speed points through TS-Auto's Virtual Wind Tunnel and feeds the results
    back into VirtualWindTunnel.correlate() to calibrate k-omega SST.

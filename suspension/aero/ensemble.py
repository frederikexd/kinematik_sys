Virtual Tunnel Solver — self-contained on KinematiK's in-house ANSYS-Fluent backend.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before using it)
---------------------------------------------------
The Virtual (Wind) Tunnel used to generate driver files for THREE external codes at
once — Star-CCM+, TS-Auto and OpenFOAM — and fuse their outputs to flag inter-code
divergence. That made the feature unusable for anyone who did not own those licenses
and a cluster to run them on: you got driver files and nothing else until you ran
them elsewhere.

This module now does the opposite. Everything happens INSIDE KinematiK:

  * the headline coefficient is computed in-house by `FluentVerificationSolver`
    (the analytic attitude model), so the user needs NO ANSYS Fluent, no other
    solver, no license and no mesh to get a usable number, and
  * for every case a complete ANSYS Fluent journal is still written, purely so the
    user can independently VERIFY the in-house number on their own Fluent install if
    and when they want to. The deck is a confirmation artefact, never a prerequisite.

The class is still called `EnsembleTunnelSolver` and still implements the full
`CFDSolver` seam (`write_case` / `run_case` / `read_result` + `provenance`), so it
remains a drop-in everywhere a backend plugs in — including
`VirtualWindTunnel.case_specs()` / `.correlate()`. What changed is its default
roster: instead of three external codes it now wraps a SINGLE member, the in-house
Fluent backend. The fusion machinery (mean/median reduction, inter-code spread,
honest holes) is fully retained for the advanced case where a caller deliberately
supplies several backends to cross-check — e.g. adding a real OpenFOAM solve next to
the in-house estimate — but the out-of-the-box behaviour is one self-contained code.

    write_case   -> writes the ANSYS Fluent verification journal for one attitude
                    (under a `fluent/` sub-directory), so the deck is on disk to run
                    whenever the user wants to confirm.
    run_case     -> returns the in-house coefficient for that attitude immediately,
                    with no external solver; the Fluent deck is left alongside it.
    read_result  -> returns the in-house number, or — if the user has run the deck
                    and staged a Fluent coeff CSV — the licensed-solver confirmation.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (same discipline as cfd.py / backends.py)
--------------------------------------------------------------
  * The in-house coefficient is labelled exactly for what it is: an analytic estimate
    at `POTENTIAL` fidelity, `is_correlated=False`. It is never dressed up as a
    Navier–Stokes solve, and its provenance/notes say so on every result.
  * When more than one member is supplied, the fused coefficient is a transparent
    reduction (mean / median) of ONLY the members that produced a converged number;
    a member that raised SolverUnavailable or did not converge contributes NOTHING.
  * `c_lift` sign convention is preserved end to end (negative = downforce).

DELIBERATE NON-GOALS, identical to the seam it sits on: this module meshes nothing
and solves no Navier-Stokes itself. The in-house number is an openly-labelled
analytic estimate; the Fluent deck it writes is for the user to run, not KinematiK.

    """
    The Virtual Tunnel Solver. It implements the `CFDSolver` protocol (so it drops
    into `VirtualWindTunnel`, `AeroOrchestrator`, and anywhere a backend is taken).

    By default it is SELF-CONTAINED: it wraps a single member, KinematiK's in-house
    `FluentVerificationSolver`, which computes the aero coefficient internally (no
    ANSYS Fluent, no other solver, no license, no mesh) and writes an ANSYS Fluent
    journal alongside each case so the user can independently verify that number on
    their own Fluent install. With one member there is nothing to "fuse" — the result
    is simply the in-house estimate, openly labelled as such.

    The fusion machinery is retained for the advanced case: pass `members=[...]` with
    several backends (e.g. the in-house estimate plus a real OpenFOAM solve) and the
    solver will reduce the converged members to a consensus and report the inter-code
    spread — agreement between independent solvers is the strongest cheap evidence a
    number is physical. That spread is recorded on every multi-member result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reduction       : "mean" (default) or "median" — how converged members are
                      combined into the consensus coefficient (only meaningful with
                      more than one member).
    agreement_tol   : maximum inter-code spread (% of mean, peak-to-peak) for a
                      multi-member fused result to be called `converged`.
    min_members     : minimum number of converged members required to report a
                      number. Default 1 — the in-house solver alone IS the answer.
                      Raise it when you supply several backends and want to require
                      cross-code agreement.
    turbulence_model: accepted for compatibility; the in-house estimate has no
                      turbulence closure, but any solver members you add can use it.
    fidelity        : labelled fidelity of the ensemble.
    mesh_params     : accepted for compatibility; ignored by the in-house estimate,
                      passed through if you supply solver members that mesh.
    members         : advanced — supply your own list of CFDSolver backends to
                      cross-check instead of the default single in-house code.

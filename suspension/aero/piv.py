Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) — correlate a MEASURED flow field against CFD.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before using it)
---------------------------------------------------
`windtunnel.py` answers one question: do the CFD *coefficients* (C_l, C_d, balance)
land on the tunnel's coefficients at the same operating point? That is necessary but
not sufficient. Two flow fields can integrate to the *same* downforce while being
physically different — the right total force for the wrong reason. A front wing can
make its number with attached flow in CFD and a fat separation bubble in reality;
an undertray can hit its C_l with the diffuser flowing in the digital world and
stalled in the real one. The coefficient correlation never sees this. The team only
learns it when the car behaves nothing like the sim mid-corner.

PIV is how you see it. You flood the test section with micron-scale oil-mist seeding,
fire a laser sheet that lights one plane of the flow, and capture two frames a known
microsecond-scale delay apart with a synchronised camera. Each tracer particle moves
a little between the two pulses. KinematiK cross-correlates the two frames in small
interrogation windows to recover, per window, the particle displacement Δx in pixels;
divide by the inter-pulse time Δt and the image magnification and you have a PHYSICAL
velocity vector at that point in space. Do it across the whole sheet and you have a
measured 2D velocity field on the exact plane your CFD wrote out — so you can overlay
the two and ask the question coefficients can't answer: *does the simulated flow
separate where the real flow separates?*

So this module's spine is:

    two laser-pulse frames (+ Δt, + magnification, + the CFD plane they sit on)
      ->  cross-correlation PIV  ->  a measured VelocityField on that plane
      ->  a vector-by-vector correlation against the CFD field sampled on the SAME
          plane, plus a separation-line comparison that says, in auditable numbers,
          whether the simulated and real flow detach in the same place.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (identical discipline to cfd.py / windtunnel.py)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A PIV field *looks* like ground truth — it is a measurement, after all — but a PIV
field is only as good as its seeding, its timing and its calibration, and a badly
set-up run lies more convincingly than CFD because it carries the authority of "we
measured it." So, by construction:

  * The laser/camera/seeder hardware lives OUTSIDE KinematiK, exactly as the
    Navier-Stokes solver does. A rig backend that cannot capture here WRITES a
    faithful, runnable acquisition plan and raises `RigUnavailable` from
    `acquire()` — it never fabricates frames or a field.
  * Every `VelocityField` carries `PIVProvenance`: seeding particle size and
    relaxation/Stokes check, the inter-pulse Δt and the particle-shift it implies
    (the one-quarter-window rule), magnification, laser-sheet plane and thickness,
    ground state, and the spatial resolution. A field whose seeding can't follow the
    flow, or whose Δt put particles out of the window, is a different measurement
    from a well-set-up one, and the provenance records the difference.
  * A correlation refuses to compare a measured vector to a CFD vector that isn't on
    the same plane / not at the same point. A hole it reports is a real hole; a
    disagreement it reports is a real disagreement — including, especially, a
    separation point the CFD got wrong.

DELIBERATE NON-GOALS, same as the rest of the aero package: this module does not
drive a laser, does not own a camera, and does not solve Navier-Stokes. It owns the
SEAM (a typed acquisition plan a real rig fulfils) and the MATH (cross-correlation
PIV reduction and the field/separation correlation), so the whole pipeline is
writable and testable now, with synthetic frames, against no hardware and no solver.

      * seeding: tracer particle diameter sets how faithfully the mist follows the
        air. Too big and the particle has inertia — it lags the flow through a shear
        layer and rounds off exactly the separation you came to measure.
      * timing: the inter-pulse Δt sets how far a particle moves between frames. The
        rule of thumb is the shift should be about a quarter of the interrogation
        window — too small and noise dominates the displacement; too large and
        particles leave the window and the correlation loses them.

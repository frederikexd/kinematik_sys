CFD co-simulation boundary — the seam where STAR-CCM+ / Fluent / OpenFOAM plug in.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before adding a solver backend)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The rest of KinematiK is analytic and instant: a constraint solve, a Pacejka
curve, a point-mass integration all return in milliseconds, the same answer every
time. A full-car CFD solve is the opposite animal — a meshed Navier–Stokes case of
tens of millions of cells, run on an MPI cluster under a scheduler, taking hours
per attitude, behind a four/five-figure solver license (STAR-CCM+, Fluent) or a
free open stack (OpenFOAM). KinematiK cannot, and must not pretend to, *be* that
solver. What it can own well is the part it's already good at: parameterising a
sweep, orchestrating the runs, and folding the result back into the lap sim.

So integration is NOT "add a CFD function that returns downforce". It is defining a
co-simulation boundary KinematiK can drive and being honest that the meshing and
the Navier–Stokes solve live OUTSIDE KinematiK, inside a licensed binary or an
OpenFOAM install on a cluster the team owns. This module is that boundary:

    * `Attitude`        — one operating point: roll, pitch, yaw, ride height, speed,
    * `RunMatrix`       — the swept grid of attitudes that becomes an aero map,
    * `CaseSpec`        — the solver-neutral description of one case to run,
    * `CoeffResult`     — the force/moment coefficients that come back (or don't),
    * `CFDProvenance`   — where the numbers came from and what's trustworthy,
    * `CFDSolver`       — the Protocol every backend implements (the contract),
    * `SolverFidelity`  — honest labelling of what a backend actually resolves.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (why it is strict here, specifically)
----------------------------------------------------------
This mirrors `tire_cosim.py` deliberately, and for the same reason. A CFD result
*looks* like measurement — it's a number with four significant figures and a
pretty wake behind it — so an uncalibrated, unconverged, or under-resolved run is
MORE dangerous than an obviously-rough hand estimate, because nobody questions it.
The trust in real aero work lives in PROVENANCE: mesh count and y+, turbulence
model, convergence of the force monitors, and correlation against a straight-line
or a wind-tunnel/coastdown point. Therefore, by construction:

  - Every `CoeffResult` carries `converged`, the residual/force-monitor history
    summary, the cell count and the y+ band — not just the coefficients.
  - A backend returns `None` for a channel it did not actually compute. It never
    fabricates a coefficient to fill a hole in the map.
  - `is_correlated` is False until a result is tied to physical reference data,
    exactly like `DamperCurve.is_calibrated` and the tyre provenance.

DELIBERATE NON-GOAL: this module does not mesh anything and does not solve
Navier–Stokes. Writing a fake RANS solve would be the failure above. It owns the
SEAM — a clean, typed, tested protocol — so a real solver drops in at one place,
and the run-matrix / aero-map / lap-sim machinery can be written and tested now
against a runnable reference backend with no external binary or license.

Surface pressure taps — turn a wind-tunnel run's RAW channels into a mapped C_p
field on the wing, and correlate that field against CFD by RMSE.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before using it)
---------------------------------------------------
`windtunnel.py` begins where the engineering insight has already been thrown away.
It correlates FINISHED coefficients — one C_l, one C_d, one balance number per ride
height. Those integrals answer "how much" but never "where", and "where" is the
question a tunnel run is uniquely able to answer. A wing makes its total downforce
number with the flow attached over the whole suction surface, or it makes the SAME
number with the leading edge over-loaded and the trailing third already stalled and
leaking — and the integral cannot tell those two wings apart. The team only finds
out which one they built when the car does something the lap sim never predicted.

A tunnel run does not actually produce a C_l. It produces a wall of RAW numbers:
a matrix of pressure-transducer voltages (one column per surface tap, one row per
sample), a load-cell force trace, and a logged wind speed. Left in that form it is
unreadable — nobody can look at forty thousand millivolt readings and see a stall.
This module is the reduction that makes the run legible, in three honest stages:

    raw transducer volts (+ calibration, + wind speed)   ->   non-dimensional C_p
      ->   C_p mapped onto the wing's surface coordinates (chordwise x/c, span)
      ->   an RMSE C_p correlation against the CFD surface at the SAME tap points,
           with the loading integral and a suction-collapse (stall) flag the
           coefficient correlation structurally cannot produce.

WHAT C_p IS, AND WHY IT IS THE RIGHT NON-DIMENSIONAL QUANTITY
-------------------------------------------------------------
The pressure coefficient

        C_p = (p - p_inf) / q ,        q = 1/2 rho V^2     (dynamic pressure)

collapses a measured surface pressure onto a scale that is independent of how fast
the tunnel was run. C_p = 1 is the stagnation point (flow brought to rest); C_p = 0
is freestream static; strongly NEGATIVE C_p is suction — and suction on the right
surface is what makes downforce. Plotting C_p along the chord is how every aero
engineer reads a wing: a healthy suction surface shows a sharp negative peak just
aft of the leading edge and a smooth pressure recovery to the trailing edge; a
stalled one shows that recovery go flat — the pressure stops recovering because the
boundary layer has detached and the surface pressure has gone constant under the
separation bubble. That flat tail is a thing you can SEE in C_p(x/c) and cannot see
in C_l. This module computes it, maps it to the wing, and measures it against CFD.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (identical discipline to cfd.py / windtunnel.py / piv.py)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A reduced C_p curve looks authoritative — it is "the measurement" — but it is only
as good as the calibration and the reference pressures behind it, and a quietly
mis-scaled transducer or a wrong q lies with the full authority of real data. So,
by construction:

  * Every `CpField` carries `TapCalibration` + the dynamic pressure it was reduced
    against. A channel whose transducer span was guessed, or whose zero was not
    taken, is a different measurement from a calibrated one, and the provenance says
    so. The freestream static and total reference pressures are recorded, not
    assumed, because C_p is meaningless without the p_inf and q it is measured from.
  * A tap with no calibration, a saturated/railed transducer, or a sample window too
    short to average down the turbulence is a HOLE — it reduces to NaN and is never
    silently filled with a neighbour or a zero.
  * The RMSE correlation pairs a measured tap to a CFD value at the SAME surface
    location (matched by tap id, never snapped to the nearest node). A tap the CFD
    surface does not cover is an unpaired hole; an RMSE it reports is over the taps
    that genuinely paired, and it says how many that was.

DELIBERATE NON-GOALS, same as the rest of the aero package: this module does not
talk to a DAQ, does not own a transducer, and does not solve Navier-Stokes. It owns
the SEAM (a typed description of the raw channels a real Scanivalve/DAQ produces)
and the MATH (volts -> C_p reduction, surface mapping, loading integral, stall
detection, and the C_p RMSE), so the whole pipeline is writable and testable now,
with synthetic raw data, against no hardware and no solver.

# plane plus one or more flaps), the chordwise fraction x/c (0 = leading edge,
# 1 = trailing edge), the spanwise station, and which surface — suction or pressure.
# This is exactly the role LaserSheetPlane plays for PIV: the shared geometry that
# makes a measured point and a CFD point the SAME point. The CFD post-processor
# samples its surface solution at these SAME (element, x/c, span) locations, so the

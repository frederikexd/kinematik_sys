Virtual Wind Tunnel — correlate a PHYSICAL aero-map run against a matching CFD run.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (read this before using it)
---------------------------------------------------
The headline reason a team runs a wind tunnel is NOT "is the car fast" — the lap
sim already answers that, faster and cheaper. The reason is CALIBRATION. A modern
aero programme lives or dies on CFD: hundreds of digital configurations get
screened before one part is ever made. But CFD only earns that trust if its
turbulence closure (for FSAE, almost always k-omega SST RANS) reproduces numbers
you actually measured. So the tunnel's job is to be the ruler the CFD is checked
against. If the digital C_d / C_l don't land on the physical C_d / C_l at the SAME
operating points, the whole digital pipeline is decoration.

That correlation has one non-negotiable rule, and it is the rule this module
enforces: **you must compare like-for-like operating points.** The physical aero
map is swept over front and rear ride height (the platform pitches and heaves under
aero load, and downforce is exquisitely ride-height sensitive on a ground-effect
car). The "Virtual Wind Tunnel" is the CFD sweep run at those EXACT same front/rear
ride heights and the same wind speed — not the team's convenient CFD grid, the
tunnel's grid. Compare a CFD point at 25/45 mm against a tunnel point at 20/40 mm
and the delta you "calibrate" away is just ride-height sensitivity masquerading as
a turbulence-model error. So this module's spine is:

    physical ride-height/speed grid  ->  the IDENTICAL CFD run matrix  ->  a
    channel-by-channel C_d/C_l/balance correlation that says, per point and
    overall, whether k-omega SST reproduced the tunnel.

WHAT THIS MODULE OWNS (and what it deliberately does not)
---------------------------------------------------------
It owns three things, in the established KinematiK idiom:

  * `RideHeights` + `ride_heights_to_attitude` / `attitude_to_ride_heights` — the
    geometry that turns the motorsport aero-map convention (FRH, RRH measured at
    the reference planes a wheelbase apart) into the `Attitude` (ride_height + rake
    pitch) the CFD seam in `cfd.py` already speaks, and back, with NO lossy
    rounding. This is the lock that makes "same operating point" literally true.

  * `PhysicalAeroMap` — the measured tunnel deliverable. It is an `AeroMap` (so the
    lap sim can consume it unchanged via `AeroProvider`) but carries TUNNEL
    provenance instead of CFD provenance: facility, blockage correction, moving-
    ground state, model scale and the Reynolds number the run was at. A tunnel
    number that wasn't blockage-corrected, or was taken on a fixed floor, is not
    the same measurement as one that was, and the provenance records the
    difference so a correlation can never imply more than the run behind it.

  * `VirtualWindTunnel` — given a `PhysicalAeroMap`, it emits the matching
    `RunMatrix` (the exact swept points) and, through any `CFDSolver` backend
    (`StarCCMSolver`, `OpenFOAMSolver`, or the vendor `TSAutoSolver` added here),
    the `CaseSpec` list a team submits. Then `correlate()` takes the CFD results
    back and produces a `TunnelCorrelationReport`: per-point and aggregate C_d /
    C_l / balance error, with an explicit verdict on whether the turbulence model
    is calibrated to the tunnel inside tolerance.

DELIBERATE NON-GOALS, same discipline as cfd.py: this module does not mesh, does
not solve Navier-Stokes, and does not invent a tunnel reading or a CFD coefficient
to fill a hole. It refuses to correlate points it cannot pair like-for-like. A
mismatch it reports is a real mismatch; a hole it reports is a real hole.

# Aero people sweep the map in FRONT ride height (FRH) and REAR ride height (RRH),
# measured at two reference planes a known longitudinal distance apart (here, the
# wheelbase, which is also `reference_length_m` in the CFD seam). The CFD `Attitude`
# instead carries a single `ride_height_mm` (the FRONT reference clearance) and a
# `pitch_deg` (nose-up positive) that captures rake. Those describe the SAME plane,
# so the map between them is exact and invertible:
#
#     rake (rear minus front, +ve = nose up) = RRH - FRH        [mm over wheelbase]
#     pitch_deg = atan2(RRH - FRH, wheelbase_mm)  in degrees
#     ride_height_mm = FRH

# Doing this in one place, tested, is what stops a 0.5 deg pitch ambiguity from
# quietly decorrelating a tunnel-vs-CFD comparison.

"""
Vehicle-level dynamics built on top of the corner kinematics.

This module turns single-corner geometry into the numbers that decide how the
car actually behaves: lateral load transfer split front/rear, individual tire
vertical loads in a steady-state corner, roll-centre heights and migration, and
a simple load-sensitive grip model so you can see understeer/oversteer balance
shift as you change geometry. This is the part spreadsheets do badly and the
reason a coupled kinematics+dynamics tool is worth open-sourcing.

GGV diagram generator.

A GGV diagram is the car's acceleration envelope: for each forward speed V, the
boundary in the (longitudinal g, lateral g) plane that the car can sustain in
steady state. Cornering, braking, accelerating, and every combination in
between — the outer edge of what the tires + power + aero will allow. Read it
and you can see, at a glance, how much combined grip you have, where the car is
power-limited vs grip-limited, and how a design change reshapes the whole
operating envelope. It is the single most useful steady-state picture a team
can have before committing to full transient vehicle modelling.

Why this module exists, given KinematiK already has `LapSim.gg_v_envelope`:
that method returns only THREE boundary points per speed — pure lateral, pure
accel, pure brake — and it reaches them through a simplified whole-car `mu`
helper. That is a fine quick check, but it is not a GGV *diagram*: it has no
combined-load points (the curved corners of the envelope where you trail-brake
into a corner or get on power at the exit), and it does not run the real
lateral+longitudinal load transfer that makes CG height, roll-centre height,
wheel rate, and camber gain actually move the boundary.

This module builds the full surface and does it THROUGH the existing
`VehicleDynamics` load-transfer + per-corner Pacejka chain, so the design
inputs an FSAE team cares about are the levers that reshape the diagram:

    * CG height            -> longitudinal AND lateral load transfer
    * roll-centre height    -> geometric vs elastic lateral transfer split
    * wheel rate / springs  -> elastic roll stiffness -> front/rear balance
    * dynamic camber gain   -> camber the loaded tire runs -> Pacejka peak
    * weight, weight dist.   -> static loads and transfer magnitudes
    * aero ClA / CdA        -> load (more grip) and drag (less top-end accel)

PROVENANCE / HONESTY
--------------------
Absolute grip is only as good as the tire model you plug in. With KinematiK's
shipped `default_tire()` the numbers are a sensible GENERIC FSAE tire — great
for *relative* questions ("does lowering the CG 10 mm widen the envelope?")
but not a number to quote as your car's measured capability. Swap in your
TTC-fitted Pacejka model and the absolute g's become trustworthy on YOUR tire.
The longitudinal side combines a tire friction-circle limit with the powertrain
(power-limited traction) and brake limits; the friction circle is the standard
elliptic combined-slip approximation unless a CombinedSlipTire is supplied.

Everything here is defensive: a single bad point never raises, it just clamps.

    Cross-check the GGV's axis limits against the lap-time model's own

    one of the two has drifted and is worth chasing before trusting either.

    What is compared, at each speed v:
      * lateral : GGV max_lat_g (at v, no aero) vs laptime._max_lat_g(veh).
                  laptime's pure-lateral grip is speed-independent (aero enters
                  only through the corner-speed fixed point), so we compare the
                  GGV's LOW-speed lateral (aero≈0) against it.
      * accel   : GGV max_accel_g(v) vs laptime._accel_long(veh, v, pt, mu, 0)/g
                  with zero lateral usage (pure forward).
      * brake   : GGV max_brake_g(v) vs laptime._decel_long(veh, v, pt, mu, 0)/g.

    `pt` is a laptime.Powertrain. The GGV is built from it via
    GGVParams.from_powertrain so the two share inputs.

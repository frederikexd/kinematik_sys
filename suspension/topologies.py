"""
Parameterised suspension-topology templates.
=============================================

Each function here returns a fully-compiled :class:`~suspension.topology.Mechanism`
for a named architecture, built from a handful of physically meaningful
parameters. They are the "drop-in" library the brief asks for:

    * ``double_wishbone``   — unequal-length A-arms (the classic FSAE corner)
    * ``macpherson_strut``  — strut + single lower arm + tie/track rod
    * ``multilink``         — N independent links to one upright (3/4/5-link)
    * ``trailing_arm``      — pure trailing arm on a lateral pivot axis
    * ``semi_trailing_arm`` — trailing arm with a skewed pivot axis
    * ``solid_axle``        — live/beam axle on links + Panhard or Watt's
    * ``twist_beam``        — torsion-beam (compound-crank) rear
    * ``truck_steer_linkage`` — heavy-truck beam-axle steering (kingpin +
                               drag link + tie rod / steering arm)
    * ``custom`` / ``from_links`` — free-form builder for experimental layouts
                               that fit no standard geometric definition.

All templates accept SAE-axis hardpoints in millimetres (x rear+, y right+,
z up+) and return a Mechanism whose ``carrier_body`` pose drives the wheel.
Where a template needs the wheel carrier to be rigid it supplies the carrier as
a Body defined by enough of its own points; where a link's far end is a chassis
pickup it is a ground point; where a node is shared between members it is a free
point. The driving DOF is wheel-vertical unless noted.

These templates are intentionally thin: the physics all lives in the kernel.
Adding a new architecture is a matter of listing its points, its carrier body,
and its constraints — not writing a new solver.

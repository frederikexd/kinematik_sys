Transient per-cell battery-pack thermal model — the answer to "which cell cooks
first, and where do I put the fan?"

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
The EV layer (`ev_powertrain.py`) already turns a virtual lap into an ENERGY
number: net kWh per lap, regen recovered, laps-until-empty. That is the right
abstraction for sizing a pack and choosing an architecture. But it collapses the
whole pack into one scalar and the whole lap into one integral, and so it cannot
answer the question that actually melts an FSAE-EV car's day at competition:

    During the endurance run the car pulls hundreds of amps in bursts on every
    corner exit. Some lithium-ion cells sit in dead air behind a bus-bar and
    others sit in the fan's draught. WHICH cells climb toward their temperature
    limit first, and where should the cooling fan(s) go so none of them do?

That is a *transient, spatial* question. It needs:
  1. the lap's CURRENT vs TIME (not energy vs distance) — the I that drives I²R,
  2. a pack laid out as a GRID of cells with real positions,
  3. a per-cell energy balance: Joule self-heating, cell↔cell conduction, and
     cell↔coolant convection whose strength VARIES with position (the airflow
     map), so moving a fan actually changes the answer,
  4. an honest read-out of the hottest cells and when they breach a limit.

This module does exactly that and nothing it can't defend. It is the pack
analogue of `tire_thermal.py`: a lumped-capacitance network with explicit,
documented conductances, the SAME calibration/provenance contract (uncalibrated
→ every thermal output is flagged `synthesized`), and the SAME never-raise
discipline as the rest of KinematiK. It WRAPS the EV lap sim at the established
seam — it reads a `LapResult`/`EVRunResult` and never reaches into the solver.

HONEST SCOPE (the same contract as the rest of the tool)
--------------------------------------------------------
- The current trace is derived from the QSS tractive-power solution: P = F·v at
  the wheels, taken back through the drivetrain efficiency to the pack, divided
  by a pack-voltage model (nominal V with a simple OCV-vs-SOC sag). It is a
  planning-grade current history, not a measured logger trace. Flagged as such.
- Heat generation per cell is ohmic, I_cell²·R_internal, plus an optional
  entropic term (off by default — it needs cell datasheet dU/dT). R_internal
  rising with temperature is modelled with a small linear tempco. No
  electrochemical (P2D/SPM) model is claimed.
- The airflow map is a geometric coefficient field h(x,y) seeded from fan
  position(s), throw and a wake/shadow falloff. It captures "cells in the
  draught cool, cells in dead air don't" — the effect that makes fan PLACEMENT
  matter — without pretending to be CFD. A real duct map can be dropped in.
- Absolute temperatures are only trustworthy once `calibrated=True` (every node
  parameter from rig data for the actual cell + measured airflow). Until then
  the module is for RANKING layouts and finding the hot corner, which is robust
  to the absolute scale — and it says so, loudly, in every result.

Never raises. Every entry point returns a result object carrying `.warnings`
and a provenance flag, mirroring `EVRunResult` and `ThermalRun`.

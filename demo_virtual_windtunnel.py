Demo: the Virtual Tunnel Solver — now SELF-CONTAINED inside KinematiK.

There is no external solver to install and no multi-code choice to make. The
Virtual Tunnel Solver computes the aero coefficients IN-HOUSE (the analytic attitude
model) at every matched ride-height point, so you get a usable, honestly-labelled
number with nothing installed: no ANSYS Fluent, no license, no mesh. For every point
it ALSO writes a complete ANSYS Fluent journal — purely so you can independently
VERIFY the in-house number on your own Fluent install whenever you want. The deck is
a confirmation artefact, never a prerequisite.

The story:
  1. Map the physical aero map in the tunnel: C_l/C_d at swept front & rear ride
     heights. Here we fabricate a small but physically-shaped measured map.
  2. Build the matching Virtual Tunnel Solver and let KinematiK ANSWER each matched
     ride-height/speed point in-house, while writing an ANSYS Fluent deck per point.
  3. Correlate the in-house map against the physical tunnel map — the same
     like-for-like calibration loop as before, now runnable end-to-end with no
     external solver in the room.

Run:  python demo_virtual_windtunnel.py
